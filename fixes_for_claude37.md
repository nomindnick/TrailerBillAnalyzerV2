# Claude 3.7 Extended Thinking Fix

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Anthropic SDK Version**
   - Changed from version 0.24.0 to 0.47.0 in requirements.txt
   - Version 0.47.0 is the first version to support extended thinking with Claude 3.7 models

2. **Fixed Code Implementation**
   - Modified embeddings_impact_analyzer.py to use streaming API with extended thinking
   - For operations that may take longer than 10 minutes, Anthropic recommends using streaming
   - Implemented a fallback to standard streaming if extended thinking fails

3. **Added Test File**
   - Created tests/anthropic_test.py to verify Claude 3.7 with extended thinking and streaming
   - This can be used to test the implementation after installing the updated SDK

## Steps to Apply Fix

1. Install the updated Anthropic SDK:
   ```
   pip install anthropic==0.47.0
   ```

2. Verify the implementation works:
   ```
   python -m tests.anthropic_test
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Implementation Details

The fix changes how extended thinking is used with Claude 3.7. For long-running operations (>10 minutes), Anthropic requires using the streaming API. We now use streaming with extended thinking.

The key code change:
```python
# Create thinking parameter for streaming API
stream_params = params.copy()
stream_params["thinking"] = {
    "type": "enabled",
    "budget_tokens": 16000
}

# Use streaming with extended thinking
response_content = ""
async with self.anthropic_client.messages.stream(**stream_params) as stream:
    async for text in stream.text_stream:
        # Accumulate response
        response_content += text
```

We keep the budget_tokens (16000) lower than the max_tokens (64000) to ensure compatibility. We also implemented a fallback to standard streaming without extended thinking in case of errors.
