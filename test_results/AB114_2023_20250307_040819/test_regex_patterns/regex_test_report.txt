Section 2574 of the Education Code is amended to read:
2574.
For the 2013–14 fiscal year and for each fiscal year thereafter, the Superintendent annually shall calculate a county local control funding formula for each county superintendent of schools as follows:
(a) Compute a county office of education operations grant equal to the sum of each of the following amounts:
(1) Six hundred fifty-five thousand nine hundred twenty dollars ($655,920).
(2) One hundred nine thousand three hundred twenty dollars ($109,320) multiplied by the number of school districts for which the county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1253.
(3) (A) Seventy dollars ($70) multiplied by the number of units of countywide average daily attendance, up to a maximum of 30,000 units.
(B) Sixty dollars ($60) multiplied by the number of units of countywide average daily attendance for the portion of countywide average daily attendance, if any, above 30,000 units, up to a maximum of 60,000 units.
(C) Fifty dollars ($50) multiplied by the number of units of countywide average daily attendance for the portion of countywide average daily attendance, if any, above 60,000, up to a maximum of 140,000 units.
(D) Forty dollars ($40) multiplied by the number of units of countywide average daily attendance for the portion of countywide average daily attendance, if any, above 140,000 units.
(E) For purposes of this section, countywide average daily attendance means the aggregate number of annual units of average daily attendance within the county attributable to all school districts for which the county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1253, charter schools authorized by school districts for which the county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction, and charter schools authorized by the county superintendent of schools.
(4) For the 2014–15 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, adjust each of the rates provided in the prior year pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) by the percentage change in the annual average value of the Implicit Price Deflator for State and Local Government Purchases of Goods and Services for the United States, as published by the United States Department of Commerce for the 12-month period ending in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. This
						percentage change shall be determined using the latest data available as of May 10 of the preceding fiscal year compared with the annual average value of the same deflator for the 12-month period ending in the third quarter of the second preceding fiscal year, using the latest data available as of May 10 of the preceding fiscal year, as reported by the Department of Finance.
(5) Commencing with the 2022–23 fiscal year, add one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000) to the amount specified in paragraph (2), as that rate was adjusted pursuant to paragraph (4).
(6) Commencing with the 2022–23 fiscal year, add fourteen dollars ($14) to each of the amounts specified in subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, of paragraph (3), as those rates were adjusted pursuant to paragraph (4).
(b) Determine the enrollment
						percentage of unduplicated pupils pursuant to the following:
(1) (A) For the 2013–14 fiscal year, divide the enrollment of unduplicated pupils in all schools operated by a county superintendent of schools in the 2013–14 fiscal year by the total enrollment in those schools in the 2013–14 fiscal year.
(B) For the 2014–15 fiscal year, divide the sum of the enrollment of unduplicated pupils in all schools operated by a county superintendent of schools in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 fiscal years by the sum of the total enrollment in those schools in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 fiscal years.
(C) For the 2015–16 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, divide the sum of the enrollment of unduplicated pupils in all schools operated by a county superintendent of schools in the current fiscal year and the two
						prior fiscal years by the sum of the total enrollment in those schools in the current fiscal year and the two prior fiscal years.
(D) (i) For purposes of the quotients determined pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the Superintendent shall use a county superintendent of schools’ enrollment of unduplicated pupils and total pupil enrollment in the 2014–15 fiscal year instead of the enrollment of unduplicated pupils and total pupil enrollment in the 2013–14 fiscal year if doing so would yield an overall greater percentage of unduplicated pupils.
(ii) It is the intent of the Legislature to review each county office of education’s enrollment of unduplicated pupils for the 2013–14 and 2014–15 fiscal years and provide one-time funding, if necessary, for a county office of education with higher enrollment of unduplicated pupils in the 2014–15 fiscal year as
						compared to the 2013–14 fiscal year.
(E) For purposes of determining the enrollment percentage of unduplicated pupils pursuant to this subdivision, enrollment in schools or classes established pursuant to Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 48645) of Chapter 4 of Part 27 of Division 4 of Title 2 and the enrollment of pupils other than the pupils identified in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (c), shall be excluded from the calculation of the enrollment percentage of unduplicated pupils.
(F) The data used to determine the percentage of unduplicated pupils shall be final once that data is no longer used in the current fiscal year calculation of the percentage of unduplicated pupils. This subparagraph does not apply to a change that is the result of an audit that has been appealed pursuant to Section 41344.
(2) For purposes of this section, an “unduplicated pupil” is a pupil who is classified as an English learner, eligible for a free or reduced-price meal, or a foster youth. For purposes of this section, the definitions in Section 42238.01 of an English learner, a pupil eligible for a free or reduced-price meal, and foster youth shall apply.

This requirement applies only if, in the course of normal duties, the county superintendent discovers information that gives the county superintendent reasonable cause to believe that false
						fiscal expenditure data relative to the conduct of an educational program has been reported.
(o) If any activities authorized pursuant to this section are found to be a state reimbursable mandate pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution, funding provided for school districts and county offices of education pursuant to Sections 2574, 2575, 42238.02, and 42238.03 shall be used to directly offset any mandated costs.

For purposes of this subdivision, a negative certification shall be assigned to a county office of education that, based upon current projections, will not meet its financial obligations for the remainder of
						the fiscal year or for the subsequent fiscal year. A qualified certification shall be assigned to a county office of education that may not meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year or two subsequent fiscal years.

This requirement applies only if, in the course of normal duties, the county superintendent discovers information that gives the county superintendent reasonable cause to believe that false
						fiscal expenditure data relative to the conduct of an educational program has been reported.
(o) If any activities authorized pursuant to this section are found to be a state reimbursable mandate pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution, funding provided for school districts and county offices of education pursuant to Sections 2574, 2575, 42238.02, and 42238.03 shall be used to directly offset any mandated costs.

(4) For the 2014–15 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, adjust each of the rates provided in the prior year pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) by the percentage change in the annual average value of the Implicit Price Deflator for State and Local Government Purchases of Goods and Services for the United States, as published by the United States Department of Commerce for the 12-month period ending in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. This
						percentage change shall be determined using the latest data available as of May 10 of the preceding fiscal year compared with the annual average value of the same deflator for the 12-month period ending in the third quarter of the second preceding fiscal year, using the latest data available as of May 10 of the preceding fiscal year, as reported by the Department of Finance.

2574.
For the 2013–14 fiscal year and for each fiscal year thereafter, the Superintendent annually shall calculate a county local control funding formula for each county superintendent of schools as follows:
(a) Compute a county office of education operations grant equal to the sum of each of the following amounts:
(1) Six hundred fifty-five thousand nine hundred twenty dollars ($655,920).
(2) One hundred nine thousand three hundred twenty dollars ($109,320) multiplied by the number of school districts for which the county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1253.
(3) (A) Seventy dollars ($70) multiplied by the number of units of countywide average daily attendance, up to a maximum of 30,000 units.
(B) Sixty dollars ($60) multiplied by the number of units of countywide average daily attendance for the portion of countywide average daily attendance, if any, above 30,000 units, up to a maximum of 60,000 units.
(C) Fifty dollars ($50) multiplied by the number of units of countywide average daily attendance for the portion of countywide average daily attendance, if any, above 60,000, up to a maximum of 140,000 units.
(D) Forty dollars ($40) multiplied by the number of units of countywide average daily attendance for the portion of countywide average daily attendance, if any, above 140,000 units.
(E) For purposes of this section, countywide average daily attendance means the aggregate number of annual units of average daily attendance within the county attributable to all school districts for which the county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1253, charter schools authorized by school districts for which the county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction, and charter schools authorized by the county superintendent of schools.
(4) For the 2014–15 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, adjust each of the rates provided in the prior year pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) by the percentage change in the annual average value of the Implicit Price Deflator for State and Local Government Purchases of Goods and Services for the United States, as published by the United States Department of Commerce for the 12-month period ending in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. This
						percentage change shall be determined using the latest data available as of May 10 of the preceding fiscal year compared with the annual average value of the same deflator for the 12-month period ending in the third quarter of the second preceding fiscal year, using the latest data available as of May 10 of the preceding fiscal year, as reported by the Department of Finance.
(5) Commencing with the 2022–23 fiscal year, add one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000) to the amount specified in paragraph (2), as that rate was adjusted pursuant to paragraph (4).
(6) Commencing with the 2022–23 fiscal year, add fourteen dollars ($14) to each of the amounts specified in subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, of paragraph (3), as those rates were adjusted pursuant to paragraph (4).
(b) Determine the enrollment
						percentage of unduplicated pupils pursuant to the following:
(1) (A) For the 2013–14 fiscal year, divide the enrollment of unduplicated pupils in all schools operated by a county superintendent of schools in the 2013–14 fiscal year by the total enrollment in those schools in the 2013–14 fiscal year.
(B) For the 2014–15 fiscal year, divide the sum of the enrollment of unduplicated pupils in all schools operated by a county superintendent of schools in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 fiscal years by the sum of the total enrollment in those schools in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 fiscal years.
(C) For the 2015–16 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, divide the sum of the enrollment of unduplicated pupils in all schools operated by a county superintendent of schools in the current fiscal year and the two
						prior fiscal years by the sum of the total enrollment in those schools in the current fiscal year and the two prior fiscal years.
(D) (i) For purposes of the quotients determined pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the Superintendent shall use a county superintendent of schools’ enrollment of unduplicated pupils and total pupil enrollment in the 2014–15 fiscal year instead of the enrollment of unduplicated pupils and total pupil enrollment in the 2013–14 fiscal year if doing so would yield an overall greater percentage of unduplicated pupils.
(ii) It is the intent of the Legislature to review each county office of education’s enrollment of unduplicated pupils for the 2013–14 and 2014–15 fiscal years and provide one-time funding, if necessary, for a county office of education with higher enrollment of unduplicated pupils in the 2014–15 fiscal year as
						compared to the 2013–14 fiscal year.
(E) For purposes of determining the enrollment percentage of unduplicated pupils pursuant to this subdivision, enrollment in schools or classes established pursuant to Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 48645) of Chapter 4 of Part 27 of Division 4 of Title 2 and the enrollment of pupils other than the pupils identified in clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (c), shall be excluded from the calculation of the enrollment percentage of unduplicated pupils.
(F) The data used to determine the percentage of unduplicated pupils shall be final once that data is no longer used in the current fiscal year calculation of the percentage of unduplicated pupils. This subparagraph does not apply to a change that is the result of an audit that has been appealed pursuant to Section 41344.
(2) For purposes of this section, an “unduplicated pupil” is a pupil who is classified as an English learner, eligible for a free or reduced-price meal, or a foster youth. For purposes of this section, the definitions in Section 42238.01 of an English learner, a pupil eligible for a free or reduced-price meal, and foster youth shall apply.

(B) The Superintendent shall make the calculations pursuant to this section using the data submitted through the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System.
(C) The Controller shall include
						instructions, as appropriate, in the audit guide required by subdivision (a) of Section 14502.1, for determining if the data reported by a county superintendent of schools using the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System is consistent with pupil data records maintained by the county office of education.
(c) Compute an alternative education grant equal to the sum of the following:
(1) (A)
(i)
For the 2013–14 fiscal
year,
year to the 2022–23 fiscal year, inclusive,

(iii) Commencing with the 2024–25 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, a base grant equal to the amount calculated pursuant to clause (ii) and as adjusted each year pursuant to subparagraph (B).
(B) Commencing with the 2013–14 fiscal year, the per pupil base grant shall be adjusted by the percentage change in the annual average value of the Implicit Price Deflator for State and Local Government Purchases of Goods and Services for the United States, as published by the United States Department of Commerce for the 12-month period ending in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. This percentage change shall be determined using the latest
						data available as of May 10 of the preceding fiscal year compared with the annual average value of the same deflator for the 12-month period ending in the third quarter of the second preceding fiscal year, using the latest data available as of May 10 of the preceding fiscal year, as reported by the Department of Finance.
