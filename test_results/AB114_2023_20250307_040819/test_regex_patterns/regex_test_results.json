In accordance with those standards, the Superintendent may reclassify a certification.

This requirement applies only if, in the course of normal duties, the county superintendent discovers information that gives the county superintendent reasonable cause to believe that false\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfiscal expenditure data relative to the conduct of an educational program has been reported.\n(o)\u00a0If any activities authorized pursuant to this section are found to be a state reimbursable mandate pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution, funding provided for school districts and county offices of education pursuant to Sections 2574, 2575, 42238.02, and 42238.03 shall be used to directly offset any mandated costs.",

Unless the school district repays the amount owed based upon an agreed-upon repayment schedule with the Superintendent, the Superintendent shall notify the Controller and the Controller shall\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdeduct an amount equal to the total amount used to purchase the textbooks and materials from the next principal apportionment of the school district or from another apportionment of state funds.\n(j)\u00a0Preserve carefully all reports of school officers and teachers.\n(k)\u00a0Deliver to county superintendent\u2019s successor, at the close of the county superintendent\u2019s official term, all records, books, documents, and papers belonging to the office, taking a receipt for them, which shall be filed with the department.\n(l)\u00a0(1)\u00a0Submit two reports during the fiscal year to the county board of education in accordance with the following:\n(A)\u00a0The first report shall cover the financial and budgetary status of the county office of education for the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tperiod ending October 31. The second report shall cover the period ending January 31. Both reports shall be reviewed by the county board of education and approved by the county superintendent no later than 45 days after the close of the period being reported.\n(B)\u00a0As part of each report, the county superintendent shall certify in writing whether or not the county office of education is able to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year and, based on current forecasts, for two subsequent fiscal years. The certifications shall be classified as positive, qualified, or negative, pursuant to standards prescribed by the Superintendent, for purposes of determining subsequent state agency actions pursuant to Section 1240.1. For purposes of this subdivision, a negative certification shall be assigned to a county office of education that, based upon current projections, will not meet its financial obligations for the remainder of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe fiscal year or for the subsequent fiscal year. A qualified certification shall be assigned to a county office of education that may not meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year or two subsequent fiscal years. A positive certification shall be assigned to a county office of education that will meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and subsequent two fiscal years. In accordance with those standards, the Superintendent may reclassify a certification. If a county office of education receives a negative certification, the Superintendent, or the Superintendent\u2019s designee, may exercise the authority set forth in subdivision (d) of Section 1630. Copies of each certification, and of the report containing that certification, shall be sent to the Superintendent at the time the certification is submitted to the county board of education. Copies of each qualified or negative certification and the report containing that certification shall be sent to the Controller at the time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe certification is submitted to the county board of education.\n(2)\u00a0All reports and certifications required under this subdivision shall be in a format or on forms prescribed by the Superintendent, and shall be based on standards and criteria for fiscal stability adopted by the state board pursuant to Section 33127.

This requirement applies only if, in the course of normal duties, the county superintendent discovers information that gives the county superintendent reasonable cause to believe that false\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfiscal expenditure data relative to the conduct of an educational program has been reported.\n(o)\u00a0If any activities authorized pursuant to this section are found to be a state reimbursable mandate pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution, funding provided for school districts and county offices of education pursuant to Sections 2574, 2575, 42238.02, and 42238.03 shall be used to directly offset any mandated costs."
