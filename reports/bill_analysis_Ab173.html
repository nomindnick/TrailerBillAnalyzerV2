<li>The proposed change to the Ebony Alert system introduces new obligations for law enforcement agencies, particularly in terms of the determinations they must make before requesting an alert. Agencies must now confirm that they have utilized all available local resources and that there is actionable information that could assist in the recovery of the missing person. This change necessitates that local agencies enhance their operational protocols to ensure compliance with these new requirements. Additionally, the mandated report to the Governor's office and the Legislature by July 1, 2027, will require local agencies to track and document their use of resources and information related to missing Black youth, which may involve new data collection and reporting processes.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law directly impacts local public agencies, particularly those involved in transportation and infrastructure projects. Local agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that are responsible for grade separation projects will need to adapt to new funding priorities and processes established by the Transportation Agency. The requirement for the agency to identify and prioritize funding for grade separation projects at risk of losing federal or local commitments means that local agencies must be proactive in securing their funding and may need to adjust their project timelines and funding strategies accordingly. Additionally, the reporting requirement to the Legislature introduces a new layer of accountability that local agencies must be prepared to meet.</li>

<li>The proposed change expands the accountability program for the distribution of funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which directly affects regional transportation planning agencies. Local agencies such as cities, counties, and transit operators will need to adapt to new requirements for submitting updated regional short-term financial plans and transit operator data to receive funding. This introduces new obligations for compliance and reporting, impacting their operational processes and potentially their budgets as they prepare for these submissions in the upcoming fiscal years.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law introduces new obligations for local public agencies, particularly in relation to the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Local agencies, such as cities and counties, will need to ensure that a certain percentage of their medium- and heavy-duty vehicle purchases comply with the zero-emission requirements set forth by the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. This will require local agencies to adapt their procurement processes and potentially increase their budgets to accommodate the higher costs associated with zero-emission vehicles. Additionally, local agencies may need to establish or enhance their charging and refueling infrastructure to support these vehicles, which could involve significant operational changes and compliance with new reporting requirements to state agencies. Overall, the change mandates a shift in how local agencies manage their vehicle fleets and interact with state regulations regarding emissions and vehicle performance.</li>

<li>The proposed change allows the Department of General Services to enter into lease-purchase agreements for a build-to-suit office facility, which may include affordable housing. This could impact local agencies, particularly in urban areas like San Francisco, as they may need to coordinate with state agencies on mixed-use developments that integrate affordable housing. Local agencies may also need to adapt their planning and zoning regulations to accommodate such developments, which could involve new compliance measures and operational adjustments. Additionally, the requirement for legislative notice and approval from the Department of Finance may necessitate changes in how local agencies approach real estate transactions and project approvals.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law imposes new obligations on local public agencies that receive high-speed rail project funds. Specifically, the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General will have the authority to review or investigate adherence to contract provisions of any public or private entity receiving these funds. This means local agencies must ensure compliance with contract provisions and may need to adapt their contracting processes to include specific access provisions for the inspector general. Additionally, the extension of whistleblower protections to contractor employees may require local agencies to revise their policies and training regarding reporting and handling of whistleblower complaints. The requirement for access to records and property will necessitate changes in how local agencies manage their contracts and oversight processes, potentially impacting their operational workflows and compliance measures.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program alters the funding allocation for planning and implementation phases. By allowing up to 25% of available funding for planning instead of a fixed 25%, local agencies may have more flexibility in how they allocate resources for projects. However, this could also lead to challenges in budgeting and project planning, as agencies may need to adapt their strategies to align with the new funding structure. Local agencies will need to reassess their project proposals and funding requests to ensure they meet the new requirements, which may involve additional administrative work and compliance with new guidelines from the Department of Transportation.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program introduces new opportunities for local public agencies to utilize their own funds for eligible projects, with the potential for future reimbursement. This change allows agencies to initiate projects without waiting for state funding, which could expedite project timelines. However, it also requires agencies to manage their own expenditures and ensure compliance with the conditions set forth for reimbursement.

<li>The proposed change to increase the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% directly impacts local public agencies involved in high-speed rail development. This change may lead to increased administrative funding for local agencies, allowing them to better manage planning and engineering tasks associated with the high-speed rail project. However, it does not create new obligations but rather modifies existing funding allocations. Local agencies may need to adapt their budgeting processes to account for the increased administrative funding and ensure compliance with the new appropriation limits set by the Legislature.</li>

Local agencies, including cities and counties, may need to apply for these funds, which could introduce new responsibilities in project planning and compliance with state guidelines.

<li>The proposed change to the Ebony Alert system introduces new obligations for law enforcement agencies, particularly in terms of the determinations they must make before requesting an alert. Agencies must now confirm that they have utilized all available local resources and that there is actionable information that could assist in the recovery of the missing person. This change necessitates that local agencies enhance their operational protocols to ensure compliance with these new requirements. Additionally, the mandated report to the Governor's office and the Legislature by July 1, 2027, will require local agencies to track and document their use of resources and information related to missing Black youth, which may involve new data collection and reporting processes.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law directly impacts local public agencies, particularly those involved in transportation and infrastructure projects. Local agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that are responsible for grade separation projects will need to adapt to new funding priorities and processes established by the Transportation Agency. The requirement for the agency to identify and prioritize funding for grade separation projects at risk of losing federal or local commitments means that local agencies must be proactive in securing their funding and may need to adjust their project timelines and funding strategies accordingly. Additionally, the reporting requirement to the Legislature introduces a new layer of accountability that local agencies must be prepared to meet.</li>

Local agencies such as cities, counties, and transit operators will need to adapt to new requirements for submitting updated regional short-term financial plans and transit operator data to receive funding.

<li>The proposed change to California law introduces new obligations for local public agencies, particularly in relation to the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Local agencies, such as cities and counties, will need to ensure that a certain percentage of their medium- and heavy-duty vehicle purchases comply with the zero-emission requirements set forth by the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. This will require local agencies to adapt their procurement processes and potentially increase their budgets to accommodate the higher costs associated with zero-emission vehicles. Additionally, local agencies may need to establish or enhance their charging and refueling infrastructure to support these vehicles, which could involve significant operational changes and compliance with new reporting requirements to state agencies. Overall, the change mandates a shift in how local agencies manage their vehicle fleets and interact with state regulations regarding emissions and vehicle performance.</li>

This could impact local agencies, particularly in urban areas like San Francisco, as they may need to coordinate with state agencies on mixed-use developments that integrate affordable housing. Local agencies may also need to adapt their planning and zoning regulations to accommodate such developments, which could involve new compliance measures and operational adjustments. Additionally, the requirement for legislative notice and approval from the Department of Finance may necessitate changes in how local agencies approach real estate transactions and project approvals.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program alters the funding allocation for planning and implementation phases. By allowing up to 25% of available funding for planning instead of a fixed 25%, local agencies may have more flexibility in how they allocate resources for projects. However, this could also lead to challenges in budgeting and project planning, as agencies may need to adapt their strategies to align with the new funding structure. Local agencies will need to reassess their project proposals and funding requests to ensure they meet the new requirements, which may involve additional administrative work and compliance with new guidelines from the Department of Transportation.</li>

This change may lead to increased administrative funding for local agencies, allowing them to better manage planning and engineering tasks associated with the high-speed rail project. However, it does not create new obligations but rather modifies existing funding allocations. Local agencies may need to adapt their budgeting processes to account for the increased administrative funding and ensure compliance with the new appropriation limits set by the Legislature.</li>
