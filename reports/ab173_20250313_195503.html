                       This bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to collaborate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. It affects local public agencies involved in transportation projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by providing them with potential funding opportunities to prevent project delays or loss of federal and local funding. These agencies are impacted as they may receive prioritized funding allocations to support critical infrastructure projects.

                       This bill increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century. This change affects local public agencies involved in the planning and implementation of high-speed rail projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by allowing more funds to be allocated for administrative costs. These agencies are impacted as they may need to adjust their budgeting and financial planning to accommodate the increased administrative funding cap.

                       This bill modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation from a fixed 25% for planning and 75% for implementation to a flexible &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning, with the remainder for implementation. This affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, and joint powers authorities (JPAs) by altering how they can apply for and utilize grant funds for converting underutilized highways into multimodal corridors. The impact includes increased flexibility in planning and implementation phases, potentially affecting project timelines and resource allocation.

                       This bill authorizes lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation, allowing them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement. This affects public agencies that administer or operate eligible port-related projects, enabling them to expedite project commencement by using their own funds upfront. The impact includes potential financial risk if reimbursement conditions are not met, but also offers flexibility in project funding and execution.
