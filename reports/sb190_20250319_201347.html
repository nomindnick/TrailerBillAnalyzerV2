                       This bill revises the Higher Education Student Housing Grant Program by changing application submission provisions, adding a new measure for ranking applications, appropriating an additional $6,000,000 to California State University, Humboldt, and repealing a previous $3,893,000 appropriation. The affected local public agencies are public postsecondary institutions, specifically the California State University system, due to their involvement in student housing projects. These agencies are impacted by changes in application processes, funding allocations, and project prioritization.

                       This bill allows the Student Aid Commission to grant an appeal for the 2023–24 academic year to institutions that failed to meet the 3-year cohort default rate due to acquiring an out-of-state institution that impacted their rate, provided the acquired institution closed between the 2019–20 and 2022–23 academic years. This change affects postsecondary educational institutions participating in the Cal Grant Program, as it provides a temporary exception to eligibility criteria, potentially allowing more institutions to offer Cal Grants to students.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill modifies the eligibility criteria for the NextUp program, which supports postsecondary education for foster youth, by changing the age requirement to be no older than 25 at the time of first enrollment rather than each academic year. It also removes additional eligibility requirements for foster youth who meet specified criteria and eliminates the waiver of income criteria as a condition of eligibility. The affected local public agencies are community college districts, as they are responsible for implementing the NextUp program and ensuring compliance with the new eligibility criteria. These agencies are impacted by needing to adjust their enrollment processes and criteria to align with the new legislative requirements.
