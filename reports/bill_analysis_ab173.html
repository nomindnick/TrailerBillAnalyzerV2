            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to collaborate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. It affects local public agencies involved in transportation projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by providing a mechanism to secure funding for projects at risk of losing federal and local commitments or facing delays. These agencies are impacted as they may receive prioritized funding to continue or complete their transportation projects.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               The bill modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation requirement from a fixed 25% for planning and 75% for implementation to a flexible &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning, with the remainder for implementation. This affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that are eligible for these grants, as they may need to adjust their project proposals and budgets to align with the new funding structure. The impact on these agencies includes potential changes in planning and implementation strategies to maximize grant opportunities.

               This bill authorizes lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This allows them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement. The affected agencies are those involved in administering or operating eligible port and freight infrastructure projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts. These agencies are impacted by gaining flexibility in project funding and execution, but must comply with conditions for reimbursement. The provisions become inoperative on June 30, 2033, and are repealed on January 1, 2034.

               This bill increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century.
