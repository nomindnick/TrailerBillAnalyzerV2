                    <strong>SECTION 1.</strong><br>
                    Section 8594.14 of the Government Code is amended to read:
8594.14.
(a) For purposes of this section, “Ebony Alert” means a notification system, activated pursuant to subdivision (b), designed to issue and coordinate alerts with respect to Black youth, including young Black women and girls, who are reported missing under unexplained or suspicious circumstances, at risk, developmentally disabled, or cognitively impaired, or who have been abducted.
(b) (1) If a person is reported missing to a law enforcement agency and that agency determines that the requirements of subdivision (c) are
						met, the law enforcement agency may request the Department of the California Highway Patrol to activate an Ebony Alert. If the Department of the California Highway Patrol concurs that the requirements of subdivision (c) have been met, it shall activate an Ebony Alert within the appropriate geographical area requested by the investigating law enforcement agency.
(2) Radio, television, cable, satellite, and social media systems are encouraged to, but not required to, cooperate with disseminating the information contained in an Ebony Alert.
(3) Upon activation of an Ebony Alert, the Department of the California Highway Patrol
						shall
						assist the investigating law enforcement agency by issuing a be-on-the-lookout alert, an electronic flyer, or changeable message signs in compliance with paragraph (4).
(4) Upon activation of an Ebony Alert, the Department of the California Highway Patrol may use a changeable message sign if both of the following conditions are met:
(A) A law enforcement agency determines that a vehicle may be involved in the missing person incident.
(B) Specific identifying information about the vehicle is available for public dissemination.
(c) A law enforcement agency may request that an Ebony Alert be activated if that agency determines that

(1) The missing person is between 12 to 25 years of age, inclusive.
(2) The investigating law enforcement agency has used all available local resources and at least one of the following conditions are met:
(A) The law enforcement agency determines that the person has gone missing under unexplained or suspicious circumstances, including circumstances that indicate any of the following:
(i) The missing person’s physical safety may be endangered.
(ii) The missing person may be subject to trafficking.
(B) The law enforcement agency believes that the person is in danger because of age, health, mental or physical disability, environmental or weather conditions, that the person is in the company of a potentially dangerous person, or that there are other factors indicating that the person may be in peril.
(d) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) shall be broadly construed in order to effectuate the legislative intent of this section.
(e) The Department of the California Highway Patrol shall create and submit a report to the Governor’s office and the Legislature that includes an evaluation of the Ebony Alert, including the efficacy, the advantages, and the impact to other alert programs. The department shall submit the report to the Legislature in compliance with

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               The bill modifies the funding allocation within the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program, changing the requirement from a fixed 25% of funding for planning to &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning, with the remainder for implementation. This affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that are eligible for these grants, as they may need to adjust their planning and implementation strategies to align with the new funding structure. The impact on these agencies includes potential changes in grant application strategies and project timelines due to the altered funding distribution.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill authorizes lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This allows them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement, provided certain conditions are met. The affected local public agencies include those that administer or operate eligible port and freight projects, as they can now expedite project funding and implementation. These agencies are impacted by gaining flexibility in project financing and potential reimbursement, but must comply with specific conditions to secure reimbursement.

               This bill increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century. This change affects local public agencies involved in the administration of high-speed rail projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by allowing them to allocate more funds towards administrative costs. The impact is primarily financial, providing these agencies with greater flexibility in managing administrative expenses related to high-speed rail development.

               This bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to collaborate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. It affects regional transportation planning agencies by requiring them to submit financial plans and data to secure funding. The impact includes prioritizing and potentially reallocating funds to projects at risk of losing federal and local funding or facing delays. The Secretary must report to the Legislature by April 30, 2025, on the funding identified.
