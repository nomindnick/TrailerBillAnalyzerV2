            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to work with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. It affects local public agencies involved in transportation projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by providing a mechanism to secure funding for projects at risk of losing federal and local commitments or facing delays. These agencies are impacted as they may receive prioritized funding to continue or complete their transportation projects.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               The bill modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation requirement. Previously, 25% of the funding was set aside for planning and 75% for implementation. The bill now allows up to 25% for planning, with the remainder for implementation. This change affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that are eligible for these grants, as it provides more flexibility in how they can allocate funds between planning and implementation phases. These agencies are impacted by having the potential to allocate more resources towards implementation, which could accelerate project timelines and enhance project outcomes.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill authorizes lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This allows them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement. The affected agencies are those involved in administering or operating eligible port and freight infrastructure projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts. These agencies are impacted by gaining flexibility in project funding and execution, allowing them to advance projects without waiting for state funds.
