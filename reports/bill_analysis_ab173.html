            <p>The legislative change allows lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This permits them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement from program funds, provided certain conditions are met. This provision is inoperative after June 30, 2033, and repealed on January 1, 2034.</p>
