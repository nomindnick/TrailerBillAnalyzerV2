            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to collaborate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. It affects local public agencies involved in transportation projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by providing a mechanism to secure funding for projects at risk of losing federal and local commitments or facing delays. These agencies are impacted as they may receive prioritized funding to continue or complete their transportation projects.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               The bill modifies the funding allocation within the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program, changing the requirement from a fixed 25% of funding for planning to &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning, with the remainder for implementation. This affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that may apply for these grants to transform underutilized state highways into multimodal corridors. These agencies are impacted by having potentially more funds available for implementation projects, which could accelerate project timelines and increase the scope of work possible.

               This bill authorizes lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This allows them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement. The affected agencies are those involved in administering or operating eligible port and freight infrastructure projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts. These agencies are impacted by gaining flexibility in project funding and execution, allowing them to advance projects without waiting for state funds.

               This bill increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century. This change affects local public agencies involved in the planning and implementation of high-speed rail projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by allowing them to allocate more funds towards administrative costs. The impact on these agencies includes increased flexibility in managing administrative expenses related to high-speed rail projects.
