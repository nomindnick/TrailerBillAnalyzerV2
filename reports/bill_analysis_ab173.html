<li>The State Air Resources Board, pursuant to its authority to regulate motor vehicle emissions and emissions of greenhouse gases, has adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation, which imposes various requirements for transitioning local, state, and federal government fleets of medium- and heavy-duty trucks, other high-priority fleets of medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and drayage trucks to zero-emission vehicles.</li>
<li>Existing law, except as provided, beginning December 31, 2025, requires at least 15% of newly purchased vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 19,000 pounds or more purchased by the Department of General Services and other state entities for the state vehicle fleet to be zero-emission vehicles. Existing law, except as provided, requires the Department of General Services, beginning no later than the 2024–25 fiscal year, to ensure that at least 50% of the</li>
<li>light-duty vehicles purchased for the state vehicle fleet each fiscal year are zero-emission vehicles.</li>
<li>This bill would require the Department of Transportation to annually compile and report information to the Legislature on or before October 1 of each year, beginning in 2025, regarding the zero-emission vehicles that the department purchases, owns, or leases. In each annual report, the bill would also require the department to conduct an analysis of the duty performance of the zero-emission vehicles that it acquires and to include information on its zero-emission vehicle charging and refueling stations, as specified. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2036.</li>

<li>lease, lease-purchase, or lease with the option to purchase real property for the use of a state agency, but prohibits the director from entering into a lease-purchase agreement for office space without specific legislative authorization.</li>
<li>This bill would authorize the Department of General Services, with the consent of the Department of Motor Vehicles, to enter into a lease-purchase agreement or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility to replace the Department of Motor Vehicles field office in the City and County of San Francisco.

Existing law authorizes the High-Speed Rail Authority to enter into contracts with private or public entities for the design, construction, and operation of high-speed trains. Existing law creates the High-Speed Rail Authority Office of the Inspector General and prohibits the office from being a subdivision of any other governmental entity. Existing law authorizes the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General to initiate audits and reviews related to the delivery of the high-speed rail project and the selection and oversight of contractors, as provided. Existing law imposes other duties and responsibilities on the inspector general relating to the oversight of the High-Speed Rail Authority, including conducting audits and investigations relating to delivery of the high-speed rail project. Existing law prohibits the inspector general from</li>
<li>investigating personnel issues regarding employees of the High-Speed Rail Authority.</li>
<li>This bill would also impose on the inspector general the duty and responsibility to review or investigate adherence to contract provisions of any public or private entity that receives high-speed rail project funds. The bill would define “personnel issues” for purposes of the above-described prohibition. The bill would extend certain whistleblower protections applicable to employees of the High-Speed Rail Authority to employees of a contractor of the authority. The bill would require the High-Speed Rail Authority to ensure that specified provisions granting the inspector general access to records and property in connection with the inspector general’s authorized duties are included in all contracts and contract amendments executed on or after July 1, 2024, in which high-speed rail project funds will be expended.
