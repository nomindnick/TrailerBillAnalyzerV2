            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to collaborate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. It affects local public agencies involved in transportation projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by providing a mechanism to secure funding for projects at risk of losing federal and local commitments or facing delays. These agencies are impacted as they may receive prioritized funding to continue or complete critical infrastructure projects.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill modifies the funding allocation requirements for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program, changing the mandate from a fixed 25% of funds for planning to allowing up to 25% for planning, with the remainder for implementation. This affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that may apply for these grants to transform underutilized highways into multimodal corridors. These agencies are impacted by having more flexibility in how they allocate grant funds between planning and implementation, potentially accelerating project timelines and focusing more resources on implementation.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill authorizes lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This allows them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement. The affected agencies are those involved in administering or operating eligible port and freight projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts. These agencies are impacted by gaining flexibility in project funding and execution, allowing them to advance projects without waiting for state funds.

               This bill increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century.
