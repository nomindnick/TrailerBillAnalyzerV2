<li>The proposed change to California law requires the Secretary of Transportation to coordinate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify funding for grade separation projects that had funding reverted. This change directly impacts local agencies, particularly those with grade separation projects that are at risk of losing federal and local funding or facing project delays. Local agencies may need to engage with the Transportation Agency to ensure their projects are considered for prioritization and potential direct allocation of funds. They will also need to monitor the secretary's report to the Legislature to understand the funding landscape for their projects. Operational processes may need to be modified to align with new prioritization criteria, and agencies will need to ensure compliance with any new reporting or application requirements. The change may affect local agency budgets by providing an opportunity to secure additional funding for critical infrastructure projects. The Business and Facilities practice group is primarily relevant due to the focus on funding and facilities, while the Public Finance group has secondary relevance due to the potential impact on financing strategies for local agencies.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law expands the accountability program requirements for the distribution of funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. Local agencies, specifically regional transportation planning agencies, will be directly impacted as they will need to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data to receive funding. This change will necessitate adjustments in budgeting, operations, and compliance measures. Agencies will need to interact more frequently with the Transportation Agency for reporting and guidance. Programs related to transit capital improvements may be affected, potentially altering service delivery to the public. Key points for public agency clients include understanding the new reporting requirements, the potential need for operational adjustments to comply with updated guidelines, and the importance of timely submissions to secure funding.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program affects local public agencies by altering the funding allocation for planning and implementation of projects. Local agencies, such as cities and counties, that are eligible for these competitive grants will need to consider the new funding structure when applying for grants. The change allows for up to 25% of available funding to be set aside for planning, with the remainder for implementation, which may provide more flexibility in funding distribution based on project needs. Agencies will need to adapt their grant applications and project planning to align with this new structure. This could impact local agency budgets by potentially increasing the funds available for implementation. Operational processes may need to be modified to ensure compliance with the new funding requirements. There may be new or altered interactions with the Department of Transportation regarding grant applications and project oversight. Programs or services related to infrastructure development and community connectivity could be impacted, potentially affecting service delivery to the public. Key points for public agency clients include understanding the new funding structure, adapting grant applications accordingly, and ensuring compliance with the updated program requirements.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program allows local public agencies that administer or operate eligible projects to apply for a letter of no prejudice, enabling them to expend their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement. This change directly impacts local agencies involved in goods movement infrastructure projects, such as port authorities, transportation agencies, and cities or counties with ports. New obligations include the need to apply for the letter and manage project financing with the understanding of potential reimbursement. Local agency budgets could be affected by fronting project costs, and operational processes may need to adapt to include tracking eligible expenditures for reimbursement. Compliance measures will include meeting the conditions for reimbursement. Interaction with the state Transportation Agency may increase due to the application process for the letter of no prejudice and subsequent reimbursement procedures. Programs or services related to goods movement infrastructure will be impacted, potentially accelerating project timelines. Key points for public agency clients include understanding the reimbursement conditions, the temporary nature of the provision (inoperative by June 30, 2033), and the need to potentially adjust financial planning for infrastructure projects.</li>

<li>The proposed law change directly impacts local public agencies by providing additional funding for the Active Transportation Program, which can be used for projects that encourage biking and walking. Local agencies such as school districts, cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities may apply for these funds to develop or enhance active transportation infrastructure. This could lead to new obligations for local agencies to plan, propose, and implement eligible projects. They may need to adapt by allocating resources for project development and grant application processes. The change could positively impact local agency budgets by providing additional funding for transportation projects, but it may also require operational processes to be modified to comply with the program's requirements. Local agencies will need to ensure they meet the criteria for funding and may have to implement new compliance measures to track and report on the use of funds. Interaction with state agencies will likely increase as local agencies apply for funding and coordinate with the California Transportation Commission. Programs or services related to transportation planning, infrastructure development, and community mobility will be impacted.

<li>The proposed change to California law regarding the activation of Ebony Alerts directly impacts local public agencies, particularly law enforcement agencies. These agencies will now have more stringent requirements to meet before requesting an Ebony Alert. They must demonstrate that all available local resources have been utilized and that there is actionable information that could lead to the safe recovery of the missing person. This change will necessitate a review and potential overhaul of current protocols related to missing Black youth to ensure compliance with the new requirements. Local agencies will need to document their use of resources and the decision-making process to justify the activation of an Ebony Alert. Additionally, the requirement for the Department of the California Highway Patrol to create and submit a report by July 1, 2027, will likely involve local agencies in providing data and information for this report. This could impact agency operations, requiring additional administrative work and potentially affecting budgets due to the need for staff time and resources to comply with these new reporting requirements.</li>

                        <ul>
<li>The State Air Resources Board, pursuant to its authority to regulate motor vehicle emissions and emissions of greenhouse gases, has adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation, which imposes various requirements for transitioning local, state, and federal government fleets of medium- and heavy-duty trucks, other high-priority fleets of medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and drayage trucks to zero-emission vehicles.</li>
<li>Existing law, except as provided, beginning December 31, 2025, requires at least 15% of newly purchased vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 19,000 pounds or more purchased by the Department of General Services and other state entities for the state vehicle fleet to be zero-emission vehicles. Existing law, except as provided, requires the Department of General Services, beginning no later than the 2024–25 fiscal year, to ensure that at least 50% of the</li>
<li>light-duty vehicles purchased for the state vehicle fleet each fiscal year are zero-emission vehicles.</li>
<li>This bill would require the Department of Transportation to annually compile and report information to the Legislature on or before October 1 of each year, beginning in 2025, regarding the zero-emission vehicles that the department purchases, owns, or leases. In each annual report, the bill would also require the department to conduct an analysis of the duty performance of the zero-emission vehicles that it acquires and to include information on its zero-emission vehicle charging and refueling stations, as specified. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2036.</li>

<li>Existing law generally authorizes the Director of General Services to hire,</li>
<li>lease, lease-purchase, or lease with the option to purchase real property for the use of a state agency, but prohibits the director from entering into a lease-purchase agreement for office space without specific legislative authorization.</li>
<li>This bill would authorize the Department of General Services, with the consent of the Department of Motor Vehicles, to enter into a lease-purchase agreement or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility to replace the Department of Motor Vehicles field office in the City and County of San Francisco. The bill would authorize the project to be a mixed-use development that may include or integrate affordable housing. The bill would require the lease to be subject to approval by the Department of Finance, and subject to specified legislative notice requirements and the Property Acquisition Law.</li>

                        <ul>
<li>Existing law creates the High-Speed Rail Authority to develop and implement a high-speed rail system in the state, with specified powers and duties. Existing law authorizes the High-Speed Rail Authority to enter into contracts with private or public entities for the design, construction, and operation of high-speed trains. Existing law creates the High-Speed Rail Authority Office of the Inspector General and prohibits the office from being a subdivision of any other governmental entity. Existing law authorizes the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General to initiate audits and reviews related to the delivery of the high-speed rail project and the selection and oversight of contractors, as provided. Existing law imposes other duties and responsibilities on the inspector general relating to the oversight of the High-Speed Rail Authority, including conducting audits and investigations relating to delivery of the high-speed rail project. Existing law prohibits the inspector general from</li>
<li>investigating personnel issues regarding employees of the High-Speed Rail Authority.</li>
<li>This bill would also impose on the inspector general the duty and responsibility to review or investigate adherence to contract provisions of any public or private entity that receives high-speed rail project funds. The bill would define “personnel issues” for purposes of the above-described prohibition. The bill would extend certain whistleblower protections applicable to employees of the High-Speed Rail Authority to employees of a contractor of the authority. The bill would require the High-Speed Rail Authority to ensure that specified provisions granting the inspector general access to records and property in connection with the inspector general’s authorized duties are included in all contracts and contract amendments executed on or after July 1, 2024, in which high-speed rail project funds will be expended. The bill would also revise the circumstances under which the Department</li>
<li>of Finance is required to notify the chairs of the budget committees of the Legislature regarding changes to the inspector general’s proposed budget.</li>

<li>Existing law, pursuant to the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century, authorizes $9,950,000,000 in general obligation bonds for high-speed rail development and other related purposes. The bond act requires the net proceeds received from the</li>
<li>sale of $9,000,000,000 principal amount of those bonds to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature in the Budget Act, for planning and engineering for the high-speed train system and capital costs, as specified. The bond act also requires not more than 2.5% of those proceeds to be used for administrative purposes, and authorizes the Legislature, by statute, to increase the percentage of those proceeds used for administrative purposes up to a limit of not more than 5%. The bond act requires the amount of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes to be appropriated in the Budget Act.</li>
<li>This bill would increase the percentage of those bond proceeds available for administrative purposes by 2.5%, thereby raising the limit to not more than 5%.</li>
