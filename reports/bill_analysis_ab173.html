                        <ul>
<li>The proposed change to California law directly impacts local public agencies, particularly those involved in transportation and infrastructure projects. Local agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that are engaged in grade separation projects will need to adapt to new funding priorities and processes established by the Transportation Agency. The requirement for the Transportation Agency to prioritize funding for grade separation projects at risk of losing federal or local commitments means that local agencies may need to reassess their project timelines and funding strategies. Additionally, the reporting requirement to the Legislature introduces a new layer of accountability that local agencies must be prepared to address. This change may necessitate adjustments in how local agencies plan and execute transportation projects, particularly in securing and managing funding.</li>

                    <div class="impact-analysis">
                        <ul>
<li>The proposed change expands the accountability program for the distribution of funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, requiring regional transportation planning agencies to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data for multiple fiscal years. This introduces new obligations for local agencies to ensure compliance with updated reporting requirements, which may necessitate adjustments in their operational processes and financial planning. Local agencies will need to allocate resources to gather and submit the required data, potentially impacting their budgets and operational workflows. Additionally, the modification of guidelines by the Transportation Agency may require ongoing adjustments to local agency practices to remain compliant with evolving requirements.</li>

                        <ul>
<li>The proposed change to California law introduces new obligations for local public agencies, particularly in relation to the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Local agencies, such as cities and counties, will need to ensure compliance with the requirements for their vehicle fleets, which may include purchasing a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles. This will necessitate operational adjustments, including potential changes in procurement processes and budget allocations to accommodate the higher costs associated with zero-emission vehicles. Additionally, local agencies may need to establish or enhance their charging and refueling infrastructure to support these vehicles. The annual reporting requirement to the Department of Transportation may also create new administrative burdens for local agencies, as they will need to track and report on their vehicle purchases and performance. Overall, the change will require local agencies to adapt their operations and compliance measures significantly.</li>

<li>The proposed change allows the Department of General Services to enter into lease-purchase agreements for a build-to-suit office facility, which may include affordable housing. This could impact local agencies, particularly in urban areas like San Francisco, as they may need to coordinate with state agencies on mixed-use developments. Local agencies may also need to adapt their planning and zoning regulations to accommodate such developments, especially if they involve affordable housing components. Additionally, the requirement for legislative notice and approval from the Department of Finance may necessitate changes in how local agencies approach real estate transactions and project approvals.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law imposes new obligations on local public agencies that receive high-speed rail project funds. Specifically, the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General will have the authority to review or investigate adherence to contract provisions of any public or private entity receiving these funds. This means local agencies must ensure compliance with contract provisions and may need to adapt their contracting processes to include specific access provisions for the inspector general. Additionally, the extension of whistleblower protections to contractor employees may require local agencies to revise their policies and training regarding reporting and handling whistleblower complaints. The requirement for access to records and property will necessitate changes in how local agencies manage their contracts and may lead to increased administrative oversight and compliance measures. Overall, local agencies will need to be proactive in adapting to these new requirements to avoid potential liabilities and ensure compliance.</li>

                        <ul>
<li>The proposed change to the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program alters the funding allocation for planning and implementation phases. By allowing up to 25% of available funding for planning instead of a fixed 25%, local agencies may have more flexibility in how they allocate resources for projects. However, this could also lead to challenges in budgeting and project planning, as agencies may need to adjust their strategies to accommodate the potential for less funding for planning activities. Local agencies, particularly cities and counties, will need to reassess their project proposals and funding requests to align with the new funding structure. Additionally, the change may require local agencies to enhance their collaboration with the Department of Transportation to ensure compliance with the new funding guidelines and to effectively implement multimodal corridor projects.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program introduces new opportunities for local public agencies to utilize their own funds for eligible projects, with the potential for future reimbursement. This change allows agencies to initiate projects without waiting for state funding, which could expedite project timelines. However, it also requires agencies to manage their own expenditures and ensure compliance with the conditions set forth for reimbursement. Local agencies will need to adapt their financial planning and project management processes to accommodate these new responsibilities, including tracking eligible expenditures and preparing for potential audits or reviews by the state. Additionally, the inoperative date of June 30, 2033, and repeal date of January 1, 2034, necessitate that agencies act promptly to take advantage of this funding mechanism before it expires.</li>

<li>The proposed change to increase the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% directly impacts local public agencies involved in high-speed rail development. This change may affect how these agencies allocate their budgets and manage administrative costs associated with the implementation of high-speed rail projects. Local agencies may need to adapt their financial planning and reporting processes to accommodate the increased administrative funding, ensuring compliance with the new limits set by the Legislature. Additionally, the change could lead to enhanced administrative capacity for local agencies, allowing for more efficient project management and oversight.</li>

<li>The proposed change to allocate $100,000,000 to the Active Transportation Program will directly impact local public agencies, particularly cities and counties that may seek funding for active transportation projects. Local agencies will need to identify eligible projects and apply for funding through the California Transportation Commission. This may require adjustments in project planning and prioritization to align with the funding criteria set by the commission. Additionally, local agencies may need to enhance their collaboration with metropolitan planning agencies to ensure that their projects are competitive for funding. The influx of funds could also lead to increased operational demands as agencies manage new projects and comply with any reporting requirements associated with the funding.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Ebony Alert system introduces new obligations for law enforcement agencies, particularly in ensuring that all local resources have been utilized before requesting an alert. This requires agencies to develop and implement protocols for resource assessment and information dissemination. Additionally, the mandatory activation of the alert by the Department of the California Highway Patrol upon concurrence adds a layer of operational responsibility for local agencies. The requirement for a report to be submitted to the Governor's office and the Legislature by July 1, 2027, also implies a need for local agencies to maintain records and data related to their use of the alert system, which could affect compliance and operational processes.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Ebony Alert system introduces new obligations for law enforcement agencies, particularly in ensuring that all local resources have been utilized before requesting an alert. This requires agencies to develop and implement protocols for resource assessment and information dissemination. Additionally, the mandatory activation of the alert by the Department of the California Highway Patrol upon concurrence adds a layer of operational responsibility for local agencies. The requirement for a report to be submitted to the Governor's office and the Legislature by July 1, 2027, also implies a need for local agencies to maintain records and data related to their use of the alert system, which could affect compliance and operational processes.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law directly impacts local public agencies, particularly those involved in transportation and infrastructure projects. Local agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that are engaged in grade separation projects will need to adapt to new funding priorities and processes established by the Transportation Agency. The requirement for the Transportation Agency to prioritize funding for grade separation projects at risk of losing federal or local commitments means that local agencies may need to reassess their project timelines and funding strategies. Additionally, the reporting requirement to the Legislature introduces a new layer of accountability that local agencies must be prepared to address. This change may necessitate adjustments in how local agencies plan and execute transportation projects, particularly in securing and managing funding.</li>

<li>The proposed change expands the accountability program for the distribution of funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, requiring regional transportation planning agencies to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data for multiple fiscal years. This introduces new obligations for local agencies to ensure compliance with updated reporting requirements, which may necessitate adjustments in their operational processes and financial planning. Local agencies will need to allocate resources to gather and submit the required data, potentially impacting their budgets and operational workflows. Additionally, the modification of guidelines by the Transportation Agency may require ongoing adjustments to local agency practices to remain compliant with evolving requirements.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law introduces new obligations for local public agencies, particularly in relation to the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Local agencies, such as cities and counties, will need to ensure compliance with the requirements for their vehicle fleets, which may include purchasing a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles. This will necessitate operational adjustments, including potential changes in procurement processes and budget allocations to accommodate the higher costs associated with zero-emission vehicles. Additionally, local agencies may need to establish or enhance their charging and refueling infrastructure to support these vehicles. The annual reporting requirement to the Department of Transportation may also create new administrative burdens for local agencies, as they will need to track and report on their vehicle purchases and performance. Overall, the change will require local agencies to adapt their operations and compliance measures significantly.</li>

<li>The proposed change allows the Department of General Services to enter into lease-purchase agreements for a build-to-suit office facility, which may include affordable housing. This could impact local agencies, particularly in urban areas like San Francisco, as they may need to coordinate with state agencies on mixed-use developments. Local agencies may also need to adapt their planning and zoning regulations to accommodate such developments, especially if they involve affordable housing components. Additionally, the requirement for legislative notice and approval from the Department of Finance may necessitate changes in how local agencies approach real estate transactions and project approvals.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program alters the funding allocation for planning and implementation phases. By allowing up to 25% of available funding for planning instead of a fixed 25%, local agencies may have more flexibility in how they allocate resources for projects. However, this could also lead to challenges in budgeting and project planning, as agencies may need to adjust their strategies to accommodate the potential for less funding for planning activities. Local agencies, particularly cities and counties, will need to reassess their project proposals and funding requests to align with the new funding structure. Additionally, the change may require local agencies to enhance their collaboration with the Department of Transportation to ensure compliance with the new funding guidelines and to effectively implement multimodal corridor projects.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program introduces new opportunities for local public agencies to utilize their own funds for eligible projects, with the potential for future reimbursement. This change allows agencies to initiate projects without waiting for state funding, which could expedite project timelines. However, it also requires agencies to manage their own expenditures and ensure compliance with the conditions set forth for reimbursement. Local agencies will need to adapt their financial planning and project management processes to accommodate these new responsibilities, including tracking eligible expenditures and preparing for potential audits or reviews by the state. Additionally, the inoperative date of June 30, 2033, and repeal date of January 1, 2034, necessitate that agencies act promptly to take advantage of this funding mechanism before it expires.</li>

This change may affect how these agencies allocate their budgets and manage administrative costs associated with the implementation of high-speed rail projects. Local agencies may need to adapt their financial planning and reporting processes to accommodate the increased administrative funding, ensuring compliance with the new limits set by the Legislature. Additionally, the change could lead to enhanced administrative capacity for local agencies, allowing for more efficient project management and oversight.</li>

<li>The proposed change to allocate $100,000,000 to the Active Transportation Program will directly impact local public agencies, particularly cities and counties that may seek funding for active transportation projects. Local agencies will need to identify eligible projects and apply for funding through the California Transportation Commission. This may require adjustments in project planning and prioritization to align with the funding criteria set by the commission. Additionally, local agencies may need to enhance their collaboration with metropolitan planning agencies to ensure that their projects are competitive for funding. The influx of funds could also lead to increased operational demands as agencies manage new projects and comply with any reporting requirements associated with the funding.</li>
