            <h4>Existing Law</h4>
            <p>Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to request the Department of the California Highway Patrol to activate an Ebony Alert, with respect to Black youth who are reported missing, as specified. Existing law requires, as a condition for requesting an Ebony Alert, that the agency determine that the alert would be an effective tool in the investigation of missing Black youth, and lists factors that the agency may consider in making that determination. If the department concurs with the agency’s determination, existing law authorizes the department to activate an Ebony Alert within the appropriate geographical area requested by the investigating law enforcement agency and to assist the agency by disseminating specified alert messages and signs.</p>
            
            
            <h4>Proposed Changes</h4>
            <p>This bill would expand and revise the determinations a law enforcement agency must make to request an Ebony Alert. In this regard, the bill would require determinations that, among other things, the investigating law enforcement agency has used all available local resources and there is information available that, if disseminated to the public, could assist in the safe recovery of the missing person. If the department concurs with the agency’s determination, the bill would make the department’s activation of an Ebony Alert and assistance to the agency, as described above, required. The bill would require, on or before July 1, 2027, the department to create and submit a report to the Governor’s office and the Legislature, as specified.</p>
            
            -->

            <h4>Agencies Impacted</h4>
            <p>law enforcement agencies: Law enforcement agencies must meet expanded criteria to request an Ebony Alert, including using all local resources and having public-assistive information.
state agencies: The Department of the California Highway Patrol is required to activate Ebony Alerts and assist law enforcement agencies if criteria are met.</p>

            <h4>Existing Law</h4>
            <p>Existing law establishes the
			 Transportation Agency, which has the power of general supervision over specified state entities, including the Department of Transportation and California Transportation Commission. Under existing law, the Transportation Agency is under the supervision of an executive officer known as the Secretary of Transportation. Existing law makes the department responsible for, among other things, the improvement and maintenance of the state highway system. Existing law requires the department to prepare and submit a proposed budget to the Governor that includes the portion to be funded from the State Highway Account. Existing law vests the commission with various powers and duties relative to the programming of transportation capital projects and the allocation of funds to those projects, pursuant to the state transportation improvement program and various other transportation funding programs.</p>
            
            
            <h4>Proposed Changes</h4>
            <p>This bill would require the secretary to coordinate with the
			 department and the commission to identify available funding in state transportation programs that may be used to support grade separation projects that were previously awarded funding under specified transportation programs but had that funding reverted pursuant to the Budget Act of 2024. The bill would require the Transportation Agency to prioritize, and would authorize the agency to directly allocate, the funding identified by that process, as available and appropriate, for those grade separation projects that are at risk of losing or failing to secure federal and local funding commitments, or that are at risk of approved project schedule delays, or both. The bill would require the secretary to report to the Legislature, on or before April 30, 2025, on any funding that the secretary identified for impacted grade separation projects.</p>

            <p>state agencies: The Transportation Agency must identify and allocate funding for specific grade separation projects. (Deadline: 2025-04-30)</p>

            <h4>Existing Law</h4>
            <p>Existing law creates the High-Speed Rail Authority to develop and implement a high-speed rail system in the state, with specified powers and duties. Existing law authorizes the High-Speed Rail Authority to enter into contracts with private or public entities for the design, construction, and operation of high-speed trains. Existing law creates the High-Speed Rail Authority Office of the Inspector General and prohibits the office from being a subdivision of any other governmental entity. Existing law authorizes the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General to initiate audits and reviews related to the delivery of the high-speed rail project and the selection and oversight of contractors, as provided. Existing law imposes other duties and responsibilities on the inspector general relating to the oversight of the High-Speed Rail Authority, including conducting audits and investigations relating to delivery of the high-speed rail project. Existing law prohibits the inspector general from
			 investigating personnel issues regarding employees of the High-Speed Rail Authority.</p>
            
            
            <h4>Proposed Changes</h4>
            <p>This bill would also impose on the inspector general the duty and responsibility to review or investigate adherence to contract provisions of any public or private entity that receives high-speed rail project funds. The bill would define “personnel issues” for purposes of the above-described prohibition. The bill would extend certain whistleblower protections applicable to employees of the High-Speed Rail Authority to employees of a contractor of the authority. The bill would require the High-Speed Rail Authority to ensure that specified provisions granting the inspector general access to records and property in connection with the inspector general’s authorized duties are included in all contracts and contract amendments executed on or after July 1, 2024, in which high-speed rail project funds will be expended. The bill would also revise the circumstances under which the Department
			 of Finance is required to notify the chairs of the budget committees of the Legislature regarding changes to the inspector general’s proposed budget.</p>
