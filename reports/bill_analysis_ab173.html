                <p>The bill authorizes lead applicant agencies to apply for a letter of no prejudice, allowing them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement from program funds.</p>

                <h4>Local Agencies Impacted</h4>
                
                    <ul class="agency-list">

                <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
                <p>Local public agencies that are lead applicants in the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program can now advance projects using their own funds with the potential for reimbursement, which may accelerate project timelines and require careful financial planning.</p>

                
                <h4>Analysis</h4>
                <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change allows local agencies to expedite port and freight infrastructure projects by using their own funds upfront. This can be beneficial in advancing project timelines but requires agencies to ensure they meet the conditions for reimbursement. Agencies must assess their financial capacity to front costs and manage the risk of non-reimbursement if conditions are not met. Legal counsel should review the terms of the letter of no prejudice and ensure compliance with all program requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</div>

        <p>The bill revises the criteria for law enforcement agencies to request an Ebony Alert, requiring them to exhaust local resources and have actionable public information, and mandates the Department of the California Highway Patrol to activate the alert if criteria are met.</p>

        <h4>Local Agencies Impacted</h4>
        
            <ul class="agency-list">
                
                <li>law enforcement agencies</li>
                
            </ul>
        

        <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
        <p>Local law enforcement agencies will need to ensure they have utilized all local resources and have actionable information before requesting an Ebony Alert. This may require additional documentation and coordination efforts.</p>

        
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change imposes new requirements on local law enforcement agencies to demonstrate that all local resources have been exhausted and that there is actionable information before requesting an Ebony Alert. This could lead to increased administrative work to document these efforts. Additionally, the Department of the California Highway Patrol is now required to activate the alert if the criteria are met, which may streamline the process but also necessitates thorough preparation by local agencies to meet the new standards. Agencies should prepare for potential audits or reviews of their compliance with these requirements.&lt;/li&gt;

        <p>The bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to identify and allocate state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024, prioritizing those at risk of losing federal or local funding or facing schedule delays.</p>

        <h4>Local Agencies Impacted</h4>
        
            <ul class="agency-list">
                
                <li>cities</li>

            </ul>
        

        <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
        <p>Local agencies involved in grade separation projects may benefit from reallocated state funds, potentially mitigating risks of losing federal or local funding and addressing project delays.</p>

        
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attorneys should note that local agencies with grade separation projects previously funded but affected by the Budget Act of 2024 may have an opportunity to secure state funding. This could alleviate financial pressures and help maintain project timelines. Agencies should assess their projects&#39; eligibility and coordinate with the Transportation Agency to ensure consideration for funding. Compliance with reporting and coordination requirements will be essential to maximize funding opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;

        <p>The bill expands the accountability program requirements to include funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and mandates updated financial plans and data submissions for additional fiscal years.</p>

        <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>

        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change requires regional transportation planning agencies to submit updated regional short-term financial plans and transit operator data to continue receiving funds under the expanded accountability program. This includes funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which adds a new layer of compliance for these agencies. The Transportation Agency is also authorized to modify guidelines for fund distribution, which may require agencies to adapt to new compliance standards. Agencies must ensure timely and accurate submissions to secure funding for the 2025–26, 2026–27, and 2027–28 fiscal years.&lt;/li&gt;

        <p>The bill modifies the funding allocation for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program, allowing up to 25% of funds for planning and the remainder for implementation, instead of a fixed 25% for planning.</p>

        <h4>Local Agencies Impacted</h4>
        
            <ul class="agency-list">

            </ul>
        

        <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
        <p>Local agencies involved in projects under this program may have increased flexibility in funding allocation, potentially allowing more resources to be directed towards implementation rather than planning.</p>

        
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change allows for more flexible use of funds, which could enable local agencies to allocate more resources towards the actual implementation of projects. This could accelerate project timelines and enhance the scope of transformations from highways to multimodal corridors. Agencies should assess their current and planned projects to determine if they can benefit from this increased flexibility in funding allocation. Additionally, they should prepare to adjust their grant applications and project plans to align with the new funding structure.&lt;/li&gt;

        <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
        <p>Local agencies, particularly metropolitan planning organizations, may have increased opportunities to apply for and receive funding for active transportation projects.</p>

        
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed appropriation of $100,000,000 to the Active Transportation Program could significantly enhance funding opportunities for local agencies involved in transportation planning and development. Agencies should prepare to identify eligible projects that align with the program&#39;s goals of promoting biking and walking. This funding could lead to increased project approvals and necessitate strategic planning to maximize the use of available funds. Compliance with application processes and alignment with program criteria will be crucial.&lt;/li&gt;

            <p>The bill mandates the Department of Transportation to report annually on zero-emission vehicles and infrastructure, with provisions expiring in 2036.</p>

            <!-- Even if no local impact, we can mention if agencies are theoretically impacted -->
            <h4>Local Agencies Impacted</h4>
            
                <p>No specific local agencies identified.</p>
            

            <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
            <p>The proposed change does not directly impact local public agencies as it specifically targets the Department of Transportation&#39;s reporting requirements.</p>

            
            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed legislation requires the Department of Transportation to compile and report data on zero-emission vehicles and related infrastructure annually. This requirement is aimed at state-level operations and does not impose new obligations on local public agencies. Local agencies should be aware of the state&#39;s direction towards zero-emission vehicles, but this bill does not directly affect their operations or compliance requirements.&lt;/li&gt;

            <p>The bill authorizes the Department of General Services to enter into a lease-purchase agreement for a new DMV office in San Francisco, potentially as a mixed-use development with affordable housing.</p>

            <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
            <p>This change does not directly impact local public agencies as it pertains specifically to state-level operations involving the Department of General Services and the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>

            
            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change allows the Department of General Services to engage in a lease-purchase agreement for a new DMV office in San Francisco, which could include affordable housing. This is a state-level initiative and does not impose new requirements or operational changes on local public agencies. Attorneys representing local agencies should be aware of this development but do not need to take action unless their clients are directly involved in related state projects.&lt;/li&gt;

            <p>The bill expands the Inspector General&#39;s duties to include reviewing adherence to contract provisions by entities receiving high-speed rail funds, extends whistleblower protections to contractors&#39; employees, and mandates contract provisions for Inspector General access to records.</p>

            <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
            <p>The proposed changes primarily affect the High-Speed Rail Authority and its contractors, with no direct impact on local public agencies such as cities, counties, or school districts.</p>

            
            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bill enhances oversight and accountability measures for the High-Speed Rail Authority by expanding the Inspector General&#39;s role and extending whistleblower protections. It requires new contractual obligations to ensure the Inspector General&#39;s access to necessary records and property. These changes aim to improve transparency and compliance in the management of high-speed rail project funds.&lt;/li&gt;

            <p>This change does not directly impact local public agencies as it pertains to the allocation of bond proceeds for administrative purposes within the high-speed rail project.</p>

            
            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change allows for a higher percentage of bond proceeds to be used for administrative costs associated with the high-speed rail project. This adjustment does not impose new compliance requirements or operational changes on local public agencies. The focus remains on the internal financial management of the high-speed rail project.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The proposed bill is focused on state budget appropriations and does not introduce new requirements or compliance obligations for local public agencies. As it does not establish a local program, there are no direct operational or financial implications for local agencies.&lt;/li&gt;
