						met, the law enforcement agency may request the Department of the California Highway Patrol to activate an Ebony Alert. If the Department of the California Highway Patrol concurs that the requirements of subdivision (c) have been met, it shall activate an Ebony Alert within the appropriate geographical area requested by the investigating law enforcement agency.
(2) Radio, television, cable, satellite, and social media systems are encouraged to, but not required to, cooperate with disseminating the information contained in an Ebony Alert.
(3) Upon activation of an Ebony Alert, the Department of the California Highway Patrol

						assist the investigating law enforcement agency by issuing a be-on-the-lookout alert, an electronic flyer, or changeable message signs in compliance with paragraph (4).
(4) Upon activation of an Ebony Alert, the Department of the California Highway Patrol may use a changeable message sign if both of the following conditions are met:
(A) A law enforcement agency determines that a vehicle may be involved in the missing person incident.
(B) Specific identifying information about the vehicle is available for public dissemination.
(c) A law enforcement agency may request that an Ebony Alert be activated if that agency determines that

(1) The missing person is between 12 to 25 years of age, inclusive.
(2) The investigating law enforcement agency has used all available local resources and at least one of the following conditions are met:
(A) The law enforcement agency determines that the person has gone missing under unexplained or suspicious circumstances, including circumstances that indicate any of the following:
(i) The missing person’s physical safety may be endangered.
(ii) The missing person may be subject to trafficking.
(B) The law enforcement agency believes that the person is in danger because of age, health, mental or physical disability, environmental or weather conditions, that the person is in the company of a potentially dangerous person, or that there are other factors indicating that the person may be in peril.
(d) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) shall be broadly construed in order to effectuate the legislative intent of this section.
(e) The Department of the California Highway Patrol shall create and submit a report to the Governor’s office and the Legislature that includes an evaluation of the Ebony Alert, including the efficacy, the advantages, and the impact to other alert programs.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to collaborate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. It affects local public agencies involved in transportation projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by providing a mechanism to secure funding for projects at risk of losing federal and local commitments or facing delays. These agencies are impacted as they may receive prioritized funding to continue or complete their transportation projects.

Section 75220) of Division 44 of the Public Resources Code) and the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program established pursuant to 
Section 2196.2 of the Streets and Highways Code but had that funding reverted pursuant to the Budget Act of 2024.
(b) Notwithstanding any other law, the agency shall prioritize, and may directly allocate, funding identified pursuant to subdivision (a), as available and appropriate, for grade separation projects described in subdivision (a) that are at risk of losing or failing to secure federal and local funding commitments, or that are at risk of approved project schedule delays, or both.

               This bill modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation requirement from a fixed 25% for planning to up to 25%, with the remainder for implementation. This affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, and joint powers authorities (JPAs) that are eligible to apply for these grants. These agencies are impacted as they may need to adjust their grant applications and project planning to align with the new funding allocation structure.

counties: Counties need to revise their project proposals to potentially increase implementation activities due to the increased funding available for such projects.
joint powers authorities: JPAs must consider the new funding flexibility in their collaborative projects, potentially increasing the scope of implementation efforts.

               This bill appropriates $100,000,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation to support the Active Transportation Program, which encourages increased use of active modes of transportation like biking and walking. The funds are to be allocated by the California Transportation Commission to eligible projects. Local public agencies such as cities, counties, and metropolitan planning organizations are affected as they may apply for and receive funding for projects that promote active transportation. These agencies are impacted by the opportunity to secure additional funding for infrastructure projects that support biking and walking, potentially enhancing local transportation networks and public health.

               This bill increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century. This change affects local public agencies involved in the administration and oversight of high-speed rail projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by allowing them to allocate more funds towards administrative costs. The impact is primarily financial, providing these agencies with greater flexibility in managing administrative expenses related to high-speed rail projects.

               This bill authorizes lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation, allowing them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement. This affects public agencies involved in port and freight infrastructure projects by providing them with a mechanism to advance project funding. The impact includes potential financial flexibility and the need to comply with specific conditions for reimbursement.

2196.3.
(a) A lead applicant agency may apply to the Secretary of Transportation or the secretary’s designee for a letter of no prejudice for a project or for any component of a project included in the program of projects awarded by the Transportation Agency pursuant to 
Section 2196.2. If approved by the Secretary of Transportation or the secretary’s designee, the letter of no prejudice shall allow the lead applicant agency to expend its own moneys for the project or any component of the project and to be eligible for future reimbursement from moneys available for the program.
(b) The amount expended under subdivision (a) shall be reimbursed by the state from moneys available for the program if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The project or project component for which the letter of no prejudice was requested has commenced, and the regional or local expenditures have been incurred.
(2) The expenditures made by the lead applicant agency are eligible for reimbursement in accordance with applicable laws and procedures. If expenditures made by the lead applicant agency are determined to be ineligible, the state has no obligation to reimburse those expenditures.
(3) The lead applicant agency complies with all legal requirements for the project, including the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with 
Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).
(4) There are moneys designated for the program that are sufficient to make the
						reimbursement payment.
(c) The lead applicant agency and the Transportation Agency shall enter into an agreement governing reimbursement as described in this section. The timing and final amount of reimbursement shall be dependent on the terms of the agreement and the availability of moneys for the program.
(d) The Transportation Agency may develop guidelines to implement this section, which shall be exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with
