<li>The proposed change to California law directly impacts local public agencies, particularly those involved in transportation projects, such as cities and counties that may be managing grade separation projects. The requirement for the Transportation Agency to prioritize and allocate funding for grade separation projects that are at risk of losing federal and local funding commitments introduces new obligations for local agencies to ensure their projects are aligned with state funding priorities. Local agencies may need to adapt their project management and funding strategies to secure state support, which could involve increased collaboration with the Transportation Agency and compliance with new reporting requirements. Additionally, the need for local agencies to monitor and potentially adjust their project timelines in response to state funding availability could lead to operational changes and budgetary impacts as they navigate these new dynamics.</li>

<li>The proposed change expands the accountability program for the distribution of funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, requiring regional transportation planning agencies to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data for multiple fiscal years. This introduces new obligations for local agencies to ensure compliance with updated reporting requirements, which may necessitate adjustments in their operational processes and financial planning. Local agencies will need to allocate resources to gather and submit the required data, potentially impacting their budgets and operational workflows. Additionally, the modification of guidelines by the Transportation Agency may require ongoing adjustments to local agency practices to remain compliant with evolving requirements.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law introduces new obligations for local public agencies, particularly in relation to the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Local agencies, including cities, counties, and special districts, will need to ensure compliance with the requirements for purchasing zero-emission vehicles, which may necessitate changes in procurement processes and budget allocations. Additionally, the requirement for the Department of Transportation to report on zero-emission vehicle performance and infrastructure may lead to increased scrutiny and expectations for local agencies to provide similar data. This could impact their operational processes and compliance measures, as they may need to establish or enhance their own reporting systems for zero-emission vehicle usage and infrastructure. Furthermore, local agencies may need to adapt their vehicle fleets to meet the new standards, which could involve significant financial and logistical considerations.</li>

<li>The proposed change allows the Department of General Services to enter into lease-purchase agreements for a build-to-suit office facility, which may include affordable housing. This could impact local agencies, particularly in urban areas like San Francisco, as they may need to coordinate with state agencies on mixed-use developments that integrate affordable housing. Local agencies may also need to adapt their planning and zoning regulations to accommodate such developments, which could involve new compliance measures and operational adjustments. Additionally, the requirement for legislative notice and approval from the Department of Finance may necessitate changes in how local agencies approach real estate transactions and project approvals.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law imposes new obligations on local public agencies that receive high-speed rail project funds. Specifically, the High-Speed Rail Authority's Inspector General will have the authority to review or investigate adherence to contract provisions of any public or private entity receiving these funds. This means local agencies must ensure compliance with contract provisions and may need to adapt their contracting processes to include specific access provisions for the Inspector General. Additionally, the extension of whistleblower protections to contractor employees may require local agencies to revise their policies and training regarding reporting and handling of whistleblower complaints. The requirement for access to records and property will necessitate changes in how local agencies manage their contracts and oversight processes, potentially impacting their operational workflows and compliance measures.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program alters the funding allocation for planning and implementation phases. By allowing up to 25% of available funding for planning instead of a fixed 25%, local agencies may have more flexibility in how they allocate resources for projects. However, this could also lead to challenges in budgeting and prioritizing projects, as local agencies may need to adapt their operational processes to align with the new funding structure. Additionally, the change may require local agencies to reassess their project planning timelines and funding requests to ensure compliance with the new guidelines.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program introduces new opportunities for local public agencies to utilize their own funds for eligible projects, with the potential for future reimbursement. This change allows agencies to initiate projects without waiting for state funding, which could expedite project timelines. However, it also requires agencies to manage their own expenditures and ensure compliance with the conditions set forth for reimbursement. Local agencies will need to adapt their financial planning and project management processes to accommodate these new responsibilities, including tracking eligible expenditures and preparing for potential audits or reviews by the state. Additionally, the inoperative date of June 30, 2033, and repeal date of January 1, 2034, necessitate that agencies act promptly to take advantage of this funding mechanism before it expires.</li>

<li>The proposed change to increase the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% directly impacts local public agencies involved in high-speed rail development. This change may affect how these agencies allocate their budgets and manage administrative costs associated with the implementation of high-speed rail projects. Local agencies may need to adapt their financial planning and reporting processes to accommodate the increased administrative funding, ensuring compliance with the new limits set by the Legislature. Additionally, the change could lead to enhanced administrative capacity for local agencies, allowing for more efficient project management and oversight.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law appropriates $100,000,000 to support the Active Transportation Program, which directly impacts local public agencies by providing funding for eligible projects that promote active transportation modes such as biking and walking. Local agencies, including cities and counties, may need to adapt their project proposals to align with the funding criteria set by the California Transportation Commission. This could involve new responsibilities in project planning, application processes, and compliance with state guidelines for the use of these funds. Additionally, local agencies may need to enhance their collaboration with metropolitan planning agencies to ensure that their projects are eligible for funding under the new allocation.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Ebony Alert system introduces new obligations for law enforcement agencies, particularly in terms of the determinations they must make before requesting an alert. Agencies must now confirm that they have utilized all available local resources and that there is actionable information that could aid in the recovery of the missing person. This change necessitates a more thorough investigation process and may require additional training for personnel involved in these cases. Furthermore, the requirement for the California Highway Patrol to activate the alert upon concurrence adds a layer of accountability and operational change for local agencies. The mandated report to the Governor's office and the Legislature by July 1, 2027, also implies a need for local agencies to maintain detailed records and data related to their alert requests, which could impact their operational processes and compliance requirements.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Ebony Alert system introduces new obligations for law enforcement agencies, particularly in terms of the determinations they must make before requesting an alert. Agencies must now confirm that they have utilized all available local resources and that there is actionable information that could aid in the recovery of the missing person. This change necessitates a more thorough investigation process and may require additional training for personnel involved in these cases. Furthermore, the requirement for the California Highway Patrol to activate the alert upon concurrence adds a layer of accountability and operational change for local agencies. The mandated report to the Governor's office and the Legislature by July 1, 2027, also implies a need for local agencies to maintain detailed records and data related to their alert requests, which could impact their operational processes and compliance requirements.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law directly impacts local public agencies, particularly those involved in transportation projects, such as cities and counties that may be managing grade separation projects. The requirement for the Transportation Agency to prioritize and allocate funding for grade separation projects that are at risk of losing federal and local funding commitments introduces new obligations for local agencies to ensure their projects are aligned with state funding priorities. Local agencies may need to adapt their project management and funding strategies to secure state support, which could involve increased collaboration with the Transportation Agency and compliance with new reporting requirements. Additionally, the need for local agencies to monitor and potentially adjust their project timelines in response to state funding availability could lead to operational changes and budgetary impacts as they navigate these new dynamics.</li>

<li>The proposed change expands the accountability program for the distribution of funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, requiring regional transportation planning agencies to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data for multiple fiscal years. This introduces new obligations for local agencies to ensure compliance with updated reporting requirements, which may necessitate adjustments in their operational processes and financial planning. Local agencies will need to allocate resources to gather and submit the required data, potentially impacting their budgets and operational workflows. Additionally, the modification of guidelines by the Transportation Agency may require ongoing adjustments to local agency practices to remain compliant with evolving requirements.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law introduces new obligations for local public agencies, particularly in relation to the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Local agencies, including cities, counties, and special districts, will need to ensure compliance with the requirements for purchasing zero-emission vehicles, which may necessitate changes in procurement processes and budget allocations. Additionally, the requirement for the Department of Transportation to report on zero-emission vehicle performance and infrastructure may lead to increased scrutiny and expectations for local agencies to provide similar data. This could impact their operational processes and compliance measures, as they may need to establish or enhance their own reporting systems for zero-emission vehicle usage and infrastructure. Furthermore, local agencies may need to adapt their vehicle fleets to meet the new standards, which could involve significant financial and logistical considerations.</li>

<li>The proposed change allows the Department of General Services to enter into lease-purchase agreements for a build-to-suit office facility, which may include affordable housing. This could impact local agencies, particularly in urban areas like San Francisco, as they may need to coordinate with state agencies on mixed-use developments that integrate affordable housing. Local agencies may also need to adapt their planning and zoning regulations to accommodate such developments, which could involve new compliance measures and operational adjustments. Additionally, the requirement for legislative notice and approval from the Department of Finance may necessitate changes in how local agencies approach real estate transactions and project approvals.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program alters the funding allocation for planning and implementation phases. By allowing up to 25% of available funding for planning instead of a fixed 25%, local agencies may have more flexibility in how they allocate resources for projects. However, this could also lead to challenges in budgeting and prioritizing projects, as local agencies may need to adapt their operational processes to align with the new funding structure. Additionally, the change may require local agencies to reassess their project planning timelines and funding requests to ensure compliance with the new guidelines.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program introduces new opportunities for local public agencies to utilize their own funds for eligible projects, with the potential for future reimbursement. This change allows agencies to initiate projects without waiting for state funding, which could expedite project timelines. However, it also requires agencies to manage their own expenditures and ensure compliance with the conditions set forth for reimbursement. Local agencies will need to adapt their financial planning and project management processes to accommodate these new responsibilities, including tracking eligible expenditures and preparing for potential audits or reviews by the state. Additionally, the inoperative date of June 30, 2033, and repeal date of January 1, 2034, necessitate that agencies act promptly to take advantage of this funding mechanism before it expires.</li>
