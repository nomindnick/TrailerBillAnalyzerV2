            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill expands and revises the determinations a law enforcement agency must make to request an Ebony Alert for missing Black youth. It affects law enforcement agencies by requiring them to use all available local resources and ensure that public dissemination of information could assist in recovery. The Department of the California Highway Patrol is now required to activate the alert if these conditions are met and must submit a report by July 1, 2027.

<li>The proposed change to California law directly impacts local public agencies, particularly those involved in transportation and infrastructure projects. Local agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that are responsible for grade separation projects will need to adapt to new funding priorities and processes established by the Transportation Agency. The requirement for the agency to identify and prioritize funding for grade separation projects at risk of losing federal or local commitments means that local agencies must be proactive in securing their funding and may need to adjust their project timelines and funding strategies accordingly. Additionally, the reporting requirement to the Legislature introduces a new layer of accountability that local agencies must be prepared to meet.</li>

<li>The proposed change expands the accountability program for the distribution of funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which directly affects regional transportation planning agencies. Local agencies such as cities, counties, and transit operators will need to adapt to new requirements for submitting updated regional short-term financial plans and transit operator data to receive funding.

<li>The proposed change to California law introduces new obligations for local public agencies, particularly in relation to the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Local agencies, such as cities and counties, will need to ensure that a certain percentage of their medium- and heavy-duty vehicle purchases comply with the zero-emission requirements set forth by the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. This will require local agencies to adapt their procurement processes and potentially increase their budgets to accommodate the higher costs associated with zero-emission vehicles. Additionally, local agencies may need to establish or enhance their charging and refueling infrastructure to support these vehicles, which could involve significant operational changes and compliance with new reporting requirements to state agencies. Overall, the change mandates a shift in how local agencies manage their vehicle fleets and interact with state regulations regarding emissions and vehicle performance.</li>

<li>The proposed change allows the Department of General Services to enter into lease-purchase agreements for a build-to-suit office facility, which may include affordable housing. This could impact local agencies, particularly in urban areas like San Francisco, as they may need to coordinate with state agencies on mixed-use developments that integrate affordable housing. Local agencies may also need to adapt their planning and zoning regulations to accommodate such developments, which could involve new compliance measures and operational adjustments. Additionally, the requirement for legislative notice and approval from the Department of Finance may necessitate changes in how local agencies approach real estate transactions and project approvals.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law introduces new obligations for local public agencies, particularly in relation to the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Local agencies, such as cities and counties, will need to ensure that a certain percentage of their medium- and heavy-duty vehicle purchases comply with the zero-emission requirements set forth by the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. This will require local agencies to adapt their procurement processes and potentially increase their budgets to accommodate the higher costs associated with zero-emission vehicles. Additionally, local agencies may need to establish or enhance their charging and refueling infrastructure to support these vehicles, which could involve significant operational changes and compliance with new reporting requirements to state agencies.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               The bill modifies the funding allocation within the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program, changing the requirement from a fixed 25% of funding for planning to &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning, with the remainder for implementation. This affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that are eligible for these grants, as they may need to adjust their planning and implementation strategies to align with the new funding structure. The impact on these agencies includes potential changes in grant application strategies and project timelines due to the altered funding distribution.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill authorizes lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This allows them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement, provided certain conditions are met. The affected local public agencies include those that administer or operate eligible port and freight projects, as they can now expedite project funding and implementation. These agencies are impacted by gaining flexibility in project financing and potential reimbursement, but must comply with specific conditions to secure reimbursement.

               This bill increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century. This change affects local public agencies involved in the administration of high-speed rail projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by allowing them to allocate more funds towards administrative costs. The impact is primarily financial, providing these agencies with greater flexibility in managing administrative expenses related to high-speed rail development.

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
               This bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to collaborate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. It affects regional transportation planning agencies by requiring them to submit financial plans and data to secure funding. The impact includes prioritizing and potentially reallocating funds to projects at risk of losing federal and local funding or facing delays. The Secretary must report to the Legislature by April 30, 2025, on the funding identified.

(7) Upon agency approval of a regional short-term financial plan pursuant to paragraph
						(1), (2), or (3), a regional transportation planning agency shall post the plan on its internet website.
(d) A regional transportation planning agency shall submit a long-term financial plan consistent with the requirements of subdivision (g) to the agency by June 30, 2026, that addresses the approach to sustain its region’s transit operations absent additional discretionary or nonformula state funding.

(4) A demonstration of how the plan will mitigate service cuts, fare increases, or layoffs relative to a 2022 service baseline to achieve short-term financial sustainability.
(5) A summary of how the
						plan will support ridership improvement strategies that focus on riders, such as coordinating schedules and ease of payment and improving cleanliness and safety, to improve the ridership experience.

(5) Opportunities for service restructuring, eliminating service redundancies, and improving coordination amongst transit operators, including, but not limited to, consolidation of agencies or reevaluation of network management and governance structure.
(6) Schedule data in General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format to enable full visibility of service and service changes where feasible.
(g) For purposes of subdivision (d), a regional long-term financial plan shall include, but is not limited to, both of the following:
