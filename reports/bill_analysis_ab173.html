                <p>The bill authorizes lead applicant agencies to apply for a letter of no prejudice, allowing them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement from program funds, effective until June 30, 2033.</p>

                <h4>Local Agencies Impacted</h4>
                
                    <ul class="agency-list">

                <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
                <p>Local public agencies involved in port and freight infrastructure projects can now advance projects using their own funds with the potential for reimbursement, providing more flexibility in project financing and timing.</p>

                
                <h4>Analysis</h4>
                <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change allows local agencies to expedite port and freight infrastructure projects by using their own funds upfront. This can help overcome delays due to funding cycles, but agencies must ensure compliance with conditions for reimbursement. Agencies should assess their financial capacity to front costs and evaluate the risks associated with potential non-reimbursement. Legal counsel should review the terms of the letter of no prejudice and ensure all conditions for reimbursement are met.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</div>

        <p>The bill revises the criteria for law enforcement agencies to request an Ebony Alert, mandates the Department of the California Highway Patrol to activate the alert if criteria are met, and requires a report by 2027.</p>

        <h4>Local Agencies Impacted</h4>
        
            <ul class="agency-list">

            </ul>
        

        <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
        <p>Local law enforcement agencies must now ensure they have exhausted all local resources and have actionable information before requesting an Ebony Alert. This may require additional documentation and coordination efforts.</p>

        
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change imposes new requirements on local law enforcement agencies to demonstrate that all local resources have been utilized and that there is actionable information before requesting an Ebony Alert. This could lead to increased administrative work to document these efforts. Additionally, the Department of the California Highway Patrol is now required to activate the alert if the criteria are met, which may streamline the process but also necessitates thorough compliance by local agencies. Agencies should prepare for potential audits or reviews of their alert requests as part of the mandated report due by 2027.&lt;/li&gt;

        <p>The bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024, prioritizing projects at risk of losing federal and local funding or facing schedule delays.</p>

        <h4>Local Agencies Impacted</h4>
        
            <ul class="agency-list">
                
                <li>cities</li>

            </ul>
        

        <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
        <p>Local agencies involved in grade separation projects may benefit from reallocated state funds, potentially mitigating risks of losing federal and local funding or facing project delays.</p>

        
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attorneys should be aware that local agencies with grade separation projects previously funded but affected by the Budget Act of 2024 may have an opportunity to secure state funding. This could alleviate financial pressures and help maintain project timelines. Agencies should assess their projects&#39; eligibility and coordinate with the Transportation Agency to ensure they are considered for funding. Compliance with reporting and coordination requirements will be essential to maximize funding opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;

        <p>The bill expands the accountability program requirements to include funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and mandates updated financial plans and data submissions for additional fiscal years.</p>

            </ul>
        

        <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
        <p>Regional transportation planning agencies must now comply with expanded reporting requirements to access additional funding sources, specifically from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, for the 2025-26 through 2027-28 fiscal years.</p>

        
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change requires regional transportation planning agencies to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data to continue receiving funds under the expanded accountability program. This includes funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which were not previously covered. Agencies must prepare for potential changes in guidelines as the Transportation Agency is authorized to modify them for each fiscal year. Compliance with these new requirements is essential to secure funding for transit projects.&lt;/li&gt;

        <p>The bill modifies the funding allocation for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program, allowing up to 25% of funds for planning and the remainder for implementation, instead of a fixed 25% for planning.</p>

        <h4>Local Agencies Impacted</h4>
        
            <ul class="agency-list">

            </ul>
        

        <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
        <p>Local agencies that are eligible for grants under this program may have increased flexibility in how they allocate funds between planning and implementation phases, potentially accelerating project timelines and enhancing project scope.</p>

        
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change allows for more flexible use of funds, which could enable local agencies to allocate more resources towards implementation if planning needs are minimal. This could lead to faster project execution and potentially larger or more comprehensive projects. Agencies should assess their current and future projects to determine if they can benefit from this flexibility. Additionally, they should prepare to adjust their grant applications and project plans to align with the new funding structure.&lt;/li&gt;

        <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
        <p>Local agencies, particularly those involved in transportation planning and infrastructure, may have increased opportunities to apply for funding for projects that promote biking and walking.</p>

        
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed appropriation of $100 million to the Active Transportation Program could significantly impact local agencies by providing additional funding opportunities for projects that enhance active transportation infrastructure. Agencies should assess their current and planned projects to determine eligibility for these funds. This funding could alleviate budget constraints and enable the development of new or expanded biking and walking paths, improving community health and reducing traffic congestion. Agencies must stay informed about the application process and criteria set by the California Transportation Commission to maximize their chances of receiving funding.&lt;/li&gt;

            <p>The bill mandates the Department of Transportation to report annually on zero-emission vehicles and infrastructure, with provisions expiring in 2036.</p>

            <!-- Even if no local impact, we can mention if agencies are theoretically impacted -->
            <h4>Local Agencies Impacted</h4>
            
                <p>No specific local agencies identified.</p>
            

            <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
            <p>The proposed change does not directly impact local public agencies as it specifically targets the Department of Transportation&#39;s reporting requirements.</p>

            
            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed legislation requires the Department of Transportation to compile and report data on zero-emission vehicles and related infrastructure annually. This requirement is aimed at state-level operations and does not impose new obligations on local public agencies. Local agencies should be aware of the state&#39;s progress in zero-emission vehicle adoption as it may influence future policy directions.&lt;/li&gt;

            <p>The bill authorizes the Department of General Services to enter into a lease-purchase agreement for a new DMV office in San Francisco, potentially as a mixed-use development with affordable housing.</p>

            <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
            <p>This change does not directly impact local public agencies as it pertains specifically to state-level operations involving the Department of General Services and the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>

            
            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change allows the Department of General Services to engage in a lease-purchase agreement for a new DMV office in San Francisco, which could include affordable housing. This is a state-level initiative and does not impose new requirements or operational changes on local public agencies. The project requires approval from the Department of Finance and adherence to legislative notice requirements and the Property Acquisition Law.&lt;/li&gt;

            <p>The bill expands the Inspector General&#39;s duties to include reviewing adherence to contract provisions by entities receiving high-speed rail funds, extends whistleblower protections to contractors&#39; employees, and mandates contract provisions for Inspector General access to records.</p>

            <h4>Local Agency Impact</h4>
            <p>The proposed changes primarily affect the High-Speed Rail Authority and its contractors, with no direct impact on local public agencies such as cities, counties, school districts, or special districts.</p>

            
            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bill enhances oversight and accountability measures related to the high-speed rail project by broadening the Inspector General&#39;s review scope and extending whistleblower protections. It requires specific contract provisions to ensure the Inspector General&#39;s access to necessary records and property. These changes aim to improve transparency and compliance in the use of high-speed rail project funds.&lt;/li&gt;

            <p>The bill increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5%.</p>

            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <div>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proposed change allows for a greater portion of the bond proceeds to be used for administrative purposes in the high-speed rail project. This adjustment does not impose new compliance requirements or operational changes on local public agencies. The focus remains on the internal allocation of funds within the high-speed rail project, which is managed at the state level.&lt;/li&gt;
