                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends Government Code Section 8594.14 to revise requirements for law enforcement agencies requesting Ebony Alerts for missing Black youth. It expands determinations agencies must make before requesting an alert, including requiring they&#39;ve exhausted local resources and have information that could help in recovery if shared publicly. It also makes CHP activation mandatory (rather than discretionary) when they concur with an agency&#39;s determination and requires CHP to submit a report by July 1, 2027.

                       This legislative change requires the Secretary of Transportation to identify available funding for grade separation projects that previously lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. The Transportation Agency will prioritize projects at risk of losing federal/local funding commitments or experiencing schedule delays. This creates potential funding opportunities for local agencies with eligible grade separation projects.

                       This legislation expands and extends the Transportation Agency&#39;s accountability program for transit funding distribution to include funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. It requires regional transportation planning agencies (RTPAs) to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data for fiscal years 2025-26, 2026-27, and 2027-28 to receive program funding. These changes impact local agencies that operate transit services or participate in regional transportation planning.

                       This legislative change requires the California Department of Transportation to annually report to the Legislature beginning October 1, 2025, regarding zero-emission vehicles it purchases, owns, or leases, including their performance and charging infrastructure. While not creating direct obligations for local agencies, it provides potentially valuable performance data that could inform local agencies&#39; own compliance strategies with the existing Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation, which requires local government fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles.

                       City: Cities with medium and heavy-duty truck fleets subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation may benefit from the Department of Transportation&#39;s reports on zero-emission vehicle performance, duty cycle analysis, and infrastructure requirements to inform their own fleet transition strategies and purchasing decisions.
County: Counties with medium and heavy-duty truck fleets subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation may benefit from the Department of Transportation&#39;s reports on zero-emission vehicle performance to inform their own fleet transition strategies and infrastructure planning.
Special District: Special districts (such as transit, utility, and sanitation districts) with medium and heavy-duty truck fleets subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation may benefit from state-generated performance data to inform their compliance approaches and vehicle procurement.

                       This legislation authorizes the Department of General Services to enter into a lease-purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility to replace the DMV field office in San Francisco. The project may include or integrate affordable housing as part of a mixed-use development. While primarily a state-level action, it has indirect impacts on local agencies in San Francisco.

                       City: The City and County of San Francisco will be indirectly impacted by this state project as it will require local permits, potentially zoning considerations, and coordination regarding the mixed-use development that may include affordable housing. The city may need to process building permits, conduct inspections, and coordinate infrastructure connections for the new DMV facility.
County: As a combined City and County, San Francisco will experience the same impacts at the county level, particularly regarding any required county-level approvals or coordination for the development.
Special District: Special districts providing utilities or services to the area may need to coordinate regarding infrastructure connections or service provision to the new development.

                       This legislative change expands the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General&#39;s oversight powers, requiring investigation of contract adherence for any entity receiving high-speed rail funds. It mandates specific contract provisions granting the Inspector General access rights in all contracts executed after July 1, 2024, and extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees. While primarily affecting the state-level High-Speed Rail Authority, local agencies that partner with or receive funds from the high-speed rail project will face increased scrutiny and compliance requirements.

                       This bill modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation requirements. Instead of a fixed 25% for planning and 75% for implementation, the new approach requires &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning and the remainder for implementation, creating more flexibility in how funds are distributed between planning and implementation phases.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that participate or want to participate in the Reconnecting Communities grant program will experience a change in potential funding allocation. The more flexible allocation potentially allows for greater implementation funding if planning needs are less than 25%. This impacts cities&#39; grant application strategies and may affect their ability to secure funds for converting underutilized highways in underserved communities.
County: Counties participating in the highway conversion grant program will need to adapt to the modified funding allocation structure. The change allows program administrators more discretion in balancing planning versus implementation funding, potentially benefiting counties ready for implementation phases.
Special District: Transportation-related special districts eligible for this program will experience modified funding parameters when applying for grants. The flexible funding allocation may increase competition for implementation dollars while potentially decreasing the total available for planning activities.
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs formed for transportation purposes that are eligible for this program will need to adapt to the modified funding structure. This could impact multi-agency collaborative projects seeking to transform highways into multimodal corridors.

                       This bill amends the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to allow lead applicant agencies to apply for a &#39;letter of no prejudice&#39; from the Secretary of Transportation. This letter would permit agencies to spend their own funds on approved projects with the ability to be reimbursed later from program funds if specific conditions are met. The provisions expire on June 30, 2033 and are repealed on January 1, 2034. This change impacts local agencies that participate in port and freight infrastructure projects.

                       This bill appropriates $100,000,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation to support the Active Transportation Program (ATP), which funds projects that encourage active modes of transportation such as biking and walking. The funds will be allocated by the California Transportation Commission and will be available until June 30, 2027, with encumbrance and liquidation until June 30, 2030. This creates significant funding opportunities for local agencies to implement active transportation infrastructure projects.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities can apply for ATP grants to fund bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure projects within their jurisdictions. The additional $100 million increases available funding for eligible projects such as bike lanes, sidewalks, safe routes to schools, and traffic calming measures. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
County: Counties can apply for ATP grants to fund active transportation projects in unincorporated areas or on a countywide basis. The increased funding creates more opportunities for counties to secure grants for regional bicycle networks, pedestrian improvements, and other related infrastructure. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Special District: Transportation-related special districts, park districts, and recreation districts may be eligible to apply for ATP grants for projects within their jurisdiction that promote active transportation. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Joint Powers Authority: Transportation JPAs and regional planning agencies may apply for ATP grants for projects that span multiple jurisdictions or provide regional active transportation solutions. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
School District: School districts may indirectly benefit from ATP-funded projects, particularly Safe Routes to School initiatives, though they typically partner with cities or counties rather than applying directly.
