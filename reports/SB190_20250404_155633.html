                       The bill amends the definition of &#39;month&#39; for calculating benefits under the Classified Community College Employee Summer Assistance Program by setting it as 20 days or 4 weeks of 5 days each (including legal holidays). This change impacts participating Community College districts by requiring them to update payroll systems, eligibility criteria, and related employee communication materials.

                       Community College: Community College districts that participate in the Summer Assistance Program must update their payroll and HR systems to reflect the new definition of a &#39;month&#39;. This will affect how classified employees’ eligibility is calculated (i.e., determining if they work 11 months or fewer out of a 12-month period) and require revisions to internal policies and employee notifications.

                       This legislative change expands the Part‐time Community College Faculty Health Insurance Program by extending coverage to multidistrict part‐time faculty. Community college districts are now required to update their health insurance programs to include faculty teaching at two or more community colleges, implement reimbursement procedures when such faculty individually purchase insurance, and meet specific criteria in order to receive full funding apportionments from the Chancellor by June 15 each year.

                       Community College: Community college districts must modify their existing health insurance programs to include multidistrict part‐time faculty. They must establish new reimbursement mechanisms for faculty who self-purchase health insurance and ensure the program meets criteria such as offering full-time equivalent benefits and limiting premium differences to qualify for additional state funding. (Deadline: June 15, 2024)

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The California Student Housing Revolving Loan Fund Act of 2022 creates a new state funding mechanism to provide zero‐interest loans for constructing affordable student and faculty/staff housing at eligible institutions. While the primary targets are higher education systems (University of California and California State University) and the California Community Colleges – the latter qualifying as local public agencies – the changes also have indirect implications for cities, counties, and special districts that oversee local planning, zoning, and infrastructure development around campuses. In addition, the legislation mandates a report submission by the California School Finance Authority and the California Educational Facilities Authority by March 15, 2025, which may affect local agencies by informing future regulatory and funding practices.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       Community College: Community Colleges (typically organized as community college districts) are directly eligible to apply for zero‐interest loans to finance affordable student and faculty/staff housing projects. They must evaluate potential construction or refurbishment projects and adhere to the guidelines of the new revolving loan fund.
City: Cities may experience increased housing development near local higher education campuses as a result of new constructions financed through the loan fund. This could necessitate updates to local zoning ordinances, permitting processes, and infrastructure planning.
County: Counties could see changes in service delivery demands and infrastructure needs from expanded student and staff housing developments around campus areas. Local planning departments may need to work closely with affected colleges and municipalities.
Special District: Special Districts responsible for utilities and related services might face adjustments due to increased loads or infrastructural changes stemming from new student/faculty housing projects. Close coordination with local agencies and project developers will be crucial.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislative change establishes a one‐time grant program under Education Code Section 17201 to support construction and renovation of affordable student housing for public postsecondary education. Although the bill is focused on higher education, local public agencies will be affected directly and indirectly. Community Colleges may pursue grant funding for new housing projects, while Cities and Counties—through their permitting, zoning, and infrastructure functions—may experience an increased workload as such projects emerge. The law takes effect immediately, so agencies must quickly evaluate their compliance and planning needs.

                       Community College: Community Colleges may be eligible to apply for one-time grants for building or renovating student housing. They will need to assess their housing needs, prepare competitive grant applications, and implement compliance and reporting protocols attached to the grant program.
City: Cities could indirectly experience an increased volume of student housing construction projects, requiring the review and possibly expedited processing of building permits and zoning adjustments in response to state-funded developments.
County: Counties may need to work closely with Community Colleges and state agencies to ensure that new student housing projects comply with local building codes and infrastructure requirements, while also addressing any shifts in local public service demands.

                       The bill amends the appeal process under the Cal Grant program by allowing, for the 2023–24 academic year only, eligible institutions that have failed to meet the 3‐year cohort default rate due to the acquisition of an out-of-state institution (which later closed between the 2019–20 and 2022–23 academic years) to file an appeal. This adjustment can help affected institutions retain their eligibility for Cal Grant awards by considering unique circumstances that previously resulted in disqualification.

Affected institutions must compile documentation to show the acquisition’s impact and the closure of the acquired institution within the specified timeframe.

                       The legislative change amends the Middle Class Scholarship Program by establishing that any student qualifying for a scholarship award of at least $1 will receive a minimum annual award of $90 for full‐time enrollment beginning in the 2022–23 academic year. Although the program is administered at the state level, the change indirectly impacts local public agencies—specifically community colleges that offer baccalaureate programs—by affecting student financial aid expectations, enrollment advising, and budgeting processes.

                       Community College: Community colleges offering baccalaureate programs will need to adjust their student advising and administrative processes to inform eligible students of the new minimum scholarship amount.

                       The legislative change revises the NextUp program&#39;s eligibility criteria for foster youth in California Community Colleges. Instead of requiring that students be under 25 at the start of every academic year in which they participate, eligibility is now determined solely based on the student&#39;s age at the commencement of the academic year in which they first enroll. Additionally, the law eliminates the provision requiring income waiver conditions. As a result, affected community colleges will need to update their enrollment policies, internal regulations, and communications with prospective students.

                       The bill revises the AANHPI Student Achievement Programs for the California Community Colleges and California State University systems. It requires the applicable statewide central office to (A) develop criteria and a process for a grant program for qualifying campuses, (B) establish an AANHPI stakeholder process, (C) prepare an annual report by March 31 each year, and (D) ensure that the independent evaluator’s report (due March 31, 2026) includes an impact assessment. These changes, though primarily affecting state-level systems, indirectly impact Community College campuses by altering how funding is allocated and compliance processes are managed.

This may require campuses to adapt internal systems to align with these changes. (Deadline: March 31, 2026)
