                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislation requires the Secretary of Transportation to identify funding for grade separation projects that lost previously awarded funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. The Transportation Agency must prioritize projects at risk of losing federal/local funding or facing schedule delays, and can directly allocate available funds to these projects. The Secretary must report to the Legislature by April 30, 2025 about identified funding for impacted grade separation projects. This impacts local agencies that sponsor or implement grade separation projects.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislation expands the Transportation Agency&#39;s accountability program to include funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. It requires regional transportation planning agencies to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data for fiscal years 2025-26 through 2027-28 to receive funding. This impacts special districts, counties, and cities that operate or oversee public transit systems or participate in regional transportation planning.

                       This legislative change requires the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to submit annual reports to the Legislature regarding its zero-emission vehicle fleet. While the reporting requirement only directly applies to the state-level Department of Transportation, the legislation relates to the broader Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation which impacts local government fleets. The regulation requires local government fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles, making this change indirectly relevant to local agencies with vehicle fleets.

                       City: While this bill only requires state-level reporting by Caltrans, it relates to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation which directly requires cities with vehicle fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles. The Caltrans reporting may influence future regulatory decisions that affect city fleets.
County: Counties with vehicle fleets are subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation referenced in this legislation. While this bill only adds reporting requirements for Caltrans, the data collected could influence future regulatory decisions affecting county fleets.
Special District: Special districts that operate vehicle fleets are subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. The Caltrans reporting required by this bill may provide data that influences future regulatory decisions affecting special district fleets.

                       This legislation authorizes the Department of General Services to enter into a lease-purchase or lease with option to purchase agreement for a new DMV field office in San Francisco. The bill allows for a mixed-use development that may include affordable housing. While primarily affecting state agencies, there are potential indirect impacts on the City and County of San Francisco related to development, planning, and housing.

                       This legislation expands the authority of the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General to review or investigate contract compliance by any entity receiving high-speed rail project funds. It extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees and requires contracts executed after July 1, 2024 to include provisions granting the Inspector General access to records. While primarily affecting state-level operations, this has indirect impacts on local agencies that may contract with or receive funds from the High-Speed Rail Authority.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislation amends the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation from a fixed 25% for planning/75% for implementation to a more flexible &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning with the remainder for implementation. This change affects local agencies that are eligible to apply for these competitive grants to convert underutilized state highways into multimodal corridors serving underserved communities.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities are eligible entities that can apply for these competitive grants. The change provides more flexibility in funding allocation, potentially allowing more implementation funding if planning needs are less than 25% of the total. Cities partnering with Caltrans on highway conversion projects will be affected by this funding formula change.
County: Counties are eligible entities that can apply for these competitive grants. The modified funding formula provides more discretion in allocating funds between planning and implementation phases, potentially allowing more implementation projects if planning needs are less than 25%.
Special District: Transportation-related special districts may be eligible entities for these grants. The change in funding allocation affects how funds are distributed between planning and implementation phases of highway conversion projects.
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs formed between local agencies for transportation purposes may be eligible to apply for these grants. The modification to the funding allocation creates more flexibility in how funds are distributed between planning and implementation phases.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislative change amends the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to allow lead applicant agencies to request letters of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This would permit agencies to use their own funds for approved port infrastructure projects with the ability to receive reimbursement from program funds later, provided certain conditions are met. The provisions sunset on June 30, 2033, and are repealed on January 1, 2034.

                       This legislation increases the percentage of bond proceeds from the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act that can be used for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5%. This change primarily affects state-level administration of high-speed rail funding with minimal direct impact on local agencies.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that have interagency agreements with the High-Speed Rail Authority or are located along proposed rail corridors may experience indirect impacts from the increased administrative funding allocation. This could potentially affect the timing of project implementation but does not create new requirements for cities.
County: Counties that have interagency agreements with the High-Speed Rail Authority or are located along proposed rail corridors may experience indirect impacts from the increased administrative funding allocation. This could potentially affect the timing of project implementation but does not create new requirements for counties.
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs that partner with the High-Speed Rail Authority or are involved in regional transportation planning may see indirect impacts from the increased administrative allocation. This change could affect coordination with state agencies but does not impose new requirements on JPAs.
