                       This bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to collaborate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. It affects local public agencies involved in transportation projects, such as cities and counties, by providing a mechanism to secure funding for projects at risk of losing federal and local commitments or facing delays. These agencies are impacted as they may receive prioritized funding to continue or complete their projects.

                       This bill increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century. This change affects local public agencies involved in the planning and implementation of high-speed rail projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by allowing more funds to be allocated for administrative costs. These agencies are impacted as they may need to adjust their budgeting and financial planning to accommodate the increased administrative funding cap.

                       This bill authorizes the Department of General Services, with the consent of the Department of Motor Vehicles, to enter into a lease-purchase agreement or lease with an option to purchase for a new build-to-suit office facility to replace the DMV field office in San Francisco. The project may include mixed-use development with affordable housing. The lease is subject to approval by the Department of Finance and legislative notice requirements. This change primarily affects state agencies involved in the development and oversight of the new DMV facility, but does not directly impact local public agencies such as cities, counties, or school districts.

                       This bill modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation from a fixed 25% for planning and 75% for implementation to a flexible &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning, with the remainder for implementation. This affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, and joint powers authorities (JPAs) by altering how they can apply for and utilize grant funding for transforming underutilized highways into multimodal corridors. The impact includes increased flexibility in planning and implementation phases, potentially affecting project timelines and resource allocation.

                       This bill introduces a provision allowing lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This letter permits agencies to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement, provided certain conditions are met. The affected local public agencies include those that administer or operate eligible port-related projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts. These agencies are impacted by gaining flexibility in project financing, allowing them to advance projects without waiting for state funds, but they must ensure compliance with reimbursement conditions.

                       This bill appropriates $100,000,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation to support the Active Transportation Program, which encourages increased use of active modes of transportation like biking and walking. The funds are to be allocated by the California Transportation Commission. Local public agencies such as cities, counties, and metropolitan planning organizations are affected as they are eligible to apply for and receive funding for projects that promote active transportation. These agencies are impacted by the opportunity to secure additional funding for infrastructure projects that support biking and walking, which may require them to prepare and submit project proposals to the commission.
