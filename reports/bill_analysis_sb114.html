                       This bill revises the California School Finance Authority Act by allowing participating parties to request local intercepts for financing, requiring county treasurers to make apportionments if they agree to participate. It limits school districts and county offices of education with qualified or negative financial certifications to intercept payments only for probable repayment of indebtedness. The affected local public agencies are school districts and county offices of education, as they must navigate new procedures for local intercepts and face restrictions on intercepting payments. These agencies are impacted by needing to coordinate with county treasurers and comply with new limitations on intercepts.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill extends the inapplicability of a specific funding distribution provision for school districts, community college districts, and direct elementary and secondary instructional services to the 2023–24 fiscal year. The affected local public agencies are school districts and community college districts, as they are directly involved in the allocation of state funds for education.

                       This bill changes the allocation of fees collected by the commission for tests, examinations, or assessments, requiring them to be deposited in the Teacher Credentials Fund instead of the Test Development and Administration Account. It affects local public agencies involved in education, such as school districts, by altering the financial management of credentialing fees. These agencies are impacted as the funds are now exempt from surplus-related fee reduction requirements and must be used for specific purposes related to test development and administration.

                       This bill clarifies that if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs will be made according to existing statutory provisions. This affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, school districts, and special districts, as they may incur costs due to state mandates. These agencies are impacted by potentially receiving reimbursements for state-mandated costs, ensuring they are not financially burdened by compliance with new state requirements.

                       This bill extends the applicability of necessary small school funding provisions to the 2023–24 fiscal year for school districts where a school was destroyed due to a state of emergency declared in August 2021. School districts are affected as they can continue to report attendance and teacher employment figures as if the destroyed school were operational, impacting their funding. This extension allows these districts to maintain financial stability and support for displaced students and teachers.

                       This bill revises the eligibility criteria for an exemption from coursework and other requirements for individuals with exceptional needs, specifying that it applies to those who entered the 9th grade in the 2022–23 school year or later. It affects local educational agencies, including school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and state special schools, by requiring them to adjust their policies to align with the new criteria for awarding diplomas to eligible students. These agencies must ensure compliance with the revised criteria and facilitate participation in graduation activities without affecting the provision of free appropriate public education.

                       This bill amends the Education Code to include long-term English learners as a separate category within the numerically significant pupil subgroups for the public school accountability system. This change affects local educational agencies, including charter schools, school districts, and county offices of education, by requiring them to separately track and report on the performance of long-term English learners. This constitutes a state-mandated local program, potentially creating new duties for these agencies.

                       This bill mandates the creation of an approved list of screening instruments for assessing reading difficulties in pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 and 2. Local educational agencies, including school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools, are affected as they must adopt and implement these screening instruments. These agencies are impacted by the requirement to assess pupils annually and provide necessary supports if reading difficulties are identified.

                       This bill extends the prohibition on school districts from submitting a local plan to create a single district special education local plan area by two years, until July 1, 2026. It affects school districts and special education local plan areas (SELPAs) by maintaining the current structure of SELPAs and requiring the Superintendent to post all local plans online. Additionally, it mandates SELPAs to allocate special education funding to member agencies based on a formula considering inflation and attendance changes, imposing additional administrative duties.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises the reporting requirements for the Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialists Grant Program, requiring interim reports from local educational agencies and the Superintendent, and mandates an independent evaluation of the program. It appropriates an additional $250,000,000 to expand the program to eligible school sites that did not receive initial funding. Local educational agencies, including school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools, are affected as they must comply with new reporting requirements and manage the allocation of additional funds. These agencies are impacted by the need to submit interim and final reports, ensure funds are not used for existing salaries, and participate in an independent evaluation.

                       The bill mandates the Superintendent of Public Instruction to award grants on a competitive basis to local educational agencies (LEAs) to implement Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) activities, funded by the federal Stronger Connections Grant Program. This affects local educational agencies, including school districts and charter schools, as they are eligible to apply for these grants to enhance or establish MTSS practices. The impact on these agencies includes the opportunity to receive funding to create safer and more supportive learning environments, focusing on academic, behavioral, and social-emotional learning practices.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill mandates that by June 30, 2024, the Director of Finance must determine if revenues distributed to local educational agencies for special education programs are less than or exceed the estimated amounts in the Budget Act of 2023. If revenues are less, funds will be appropriated from the General Fund to the Superintendent for distribution to these agencies. If revenues exceed estimates, the appropriation will be reduced. This affects local educational agencies, including school districts, as it directly impacts their funding for special education programs based on revenue assessments. These agencies are impacted by potential changes in funding allocations, which could affect their budgeting and program planning for special education.

                       This bill extends the availability of appropriated funds for the California Preschool, Transitional Kindergarten, and Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program, allowing school districts more time to use these funds for constructing or retrofitting facilities. The affected local public agencies are school districts, county offices of education, and community college districts that operate preschool programs. These agencies are impacted as they now have extended deadlines to utilize grant funds for facility projects, which can aid in expanding or improving educational facilities for preschool, transitional kindergarten, and full-day kindergarten programs.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill removes the requirement for the Controller&#39;s audit guide to include instructions for determining unspent funds associated with Charter School Facilities Program projects, Career Technical Education Facilities Program projects, and projects where local educational agencies received hardship funding. Local educational agencies, specifically those involved in these programs, are affected as they will no longer need to follow these specific audit instructions. This change impacts how these agencies report and manage their project funds, potentially simplifying their audit processes.

                       This bill exempts school districts with an approved districtwide charter petition from the transportation funding provisions that require a transportation allowance and the development of a transportation plan. The affected local public agencies are school districts that have converted all their schools to charter schools under an approved districtwide charter petition. These districts will no longer be required to develop transportation plans or receive transportation allowances, impacting their funding and planning processes.

                       This bill revises existing provisions by requiring the Department of Education to provide the Commission on Teacher Credentialing with comprehensive educator assignment data, including those on preliminary or clear credentials, intern credentials, permits, waivers, misassignments, and vacant positions. It mandates that local educational agencies have access to assignment monitoring results and requires the publication of annual educator assignment data. The bill impacts school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and state special schools by expanding monitoring and reporting requirements, and it imposes new duties on county superintendents and local educational agencies, constituting a state-mandated local program.

                       This bill introduces specific licensing requirements for expanded learning opportunity programs based on whether they are operated directly by a local educational agency or by a third party. It affects local educational agencies, including charter schools and school districts, by requiring them to comply with new reporting and operational standards when contracting with third-party providers. These agencies are impacted by needing to establish processes for third-party operations, submit program access information, and adhere to new financial expenditure timelines.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill delays the requirement for school districts and charter schools to maintain an average of at least one adult for every 10 pupils in transitional kindergarten classrooms until the 2025–26 school year and removes the contingency on fund appropriation. It also extends the deadline for credentialed teachers assigned to transitional kindergarten classrooms to meet qualification criteria to August 1, 2025. The bill affects school districts and charter schools by altering staffing and reporting requirements, impacting their operational and financial planning.

                       This bill modifies the Charter Schools Act of 1992 by changing the conditions under which the State Board of Education can reverse decisions on charter petitions, extending the term of certain charter schools, and extending the prohibition on new nonclassroom-based charter schools. It affects local educational agencies, specifically school districts and county boards of education, by imposing new duties related to charter school petitions and renewals. These agencies are impacted by having to adjust their processes for handling charter school petitions and renewals, and by the extension of the prohibition on nonclassroom-based charter schools.

                       This bill reduces the appropriation from the General Fund to the Superintendent for apportionment to certain charter schools in the 2022–23 fiscal year by $122,977,000, resulting in a new total of $290,023,000. The affected local public agencies are charter schools, specifically those that are not classified as nonclassroom-based charter schools as of the 2021–22 fiscal year. These charter schools are impacted by a reduction in funding, which may affect their budget planning and operations for the fiscal year.

                       This bill reduces the appropriation for the Arts, Music, and Instructional Materials Discretionary Block Grant from $3,560,885,000 to $3,360,885,000 for the 2022–23 fiscal year. The affected local public agencies include county offices of education, school districts, charter schools, and state special schools, as they are the recipients of these funds. These agencies are impacted by a decrease in available funding, which may affect their ability to obtain instructional materials, professional development, and cover operational costs.

                       This bill establishes the Diverse Education Leaders Pipeline Initiative program, requiring the Superintendent of Public Instruction to allocate funding to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing for grants to local educational agencies. These grants aim to train, place, and retain diverse and culturally responsive administrators in transitional kindergarten through grade 12. Local educational agencies, including school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools, are affected as they are eligible to receive grants of up to $30,000 per administrator candidate. These agencies are impacted by the need to apply for grants, demonstrate commitment to diversity, and manage the training and placement of administrator candidates.

                       This bill appropriates $1,000,000 from the General Fund to the State Department of Education to develop a Literacy Roadmap. This roadmap is intended to assist educators in applying the state&#39;s curriculum framework to classroom instruction, with a focus on improving literacy outcomes for all pupils, emphasizing equity. Local educational agencies, including school districts and charter schools, are affected as they will need to integrate this roadmap into their literacy instruction practices. These agencies are impacted by needing to align their literacy instruction with the new roadmap and ensure educators are trained to use it effectively.

                       This bill repeals Sections 52072 and 52072.5 of the Education Code, which were obsolete provisions. The affected local public agencies are school districts and charter schools, as these sections pertain to educational regulations. The impact on these agencies is minimal as the provisions were obsolete, meaning there are no new compliance requirements or operational changes needed.

                       This bill amends Section 42238.02 of the Education Code to adjust the local control funding formula for school districts and charter schools. It affects school districts and charter schools by modifying how funding is calculated based on unduplicated pupil counts, which include English learners, foster youth, and students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. The changes impact funding allocations and require accurate data reporting and validation.

                       This bill modifies the existing law by changing the criteria for teacher misassignment complaints under the uniform complaint process. It affects school districts by requiring them to address complaints if a teacher lacking credentials or training to teach English learners is assigned to a class with any English learner pupils, rather than the previous threshold of more than 20%. This imposes new obligations on school districts, potentially increasing the number of complaints they must address.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises the intervention process for county offices of education and school districts by creating two separate processes. It affects county offices of education and school districts by imposing new duties related to collaboration with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. These agencies are impacted as they may be identified for intervention if they fail to implement recommendations or have persistent inadequate performance, leading to potential changes in their local control and accountability plans and budgets.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill introduces a severability clause, ensuring that if any part of the act is found invalid, the remaining provisions remain effective. No specific local public agencies are directly impacted by this change, as it is a general legislative provision affecting the interpretation of the bill itself. The impact is primarily on the legal interpretation and enforcement of the bill&#39;s provisions, ensuring that invalidity of one part does not nullify the entire act.

                       This bill revises existing provisions regarding wage overpayment recoupment by school employers. It affects school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools by changing notification and recoupment procedures, including requiring written notification of overpayment, removing the option for full repayment through payroll deductions for overpayments older than one year, and mandating legal action or arbitration for disputed overpayments. These changes impact how these agencies manage wage overpayment recovery and employee disputes.

                       This bill modifies the Teacher Residency Grant Program by increasing the grant amount per residency candidate from $25,000 to $40,000 and requires candidates to serve in any public school in California for at least 4 school years. It mandates a minimum compensation package of $20,000 for residency candidates starting in the 2023–24 fiscal year. The deadline for the commission to report on the program&#39;s effectiveness is extended to December 1, 2029. Affected local public agencies include school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and regional occupational centers, as they are eligible to apply for and manage these grants. These agencies must adjust their financial and administrative processes to comply with the new grant requirements and reporting obligations.

The bill also allows service at a school listed on the most recent priority school list to count towards the service requirement, even if the school is later removed from the list. Local public agencies such as school districts and preschool programs are affected as they may see an increase in qualified teaching staff due to the expanded grant program. These agencies are impacted by potentially having more candidates available for teaching positions, particularly in priority schools and preschools.
