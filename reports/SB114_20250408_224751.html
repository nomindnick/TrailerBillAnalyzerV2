                           The legislative change revises California’s public school financing system by updating the alternative education grant. It increases the base grant component through a revised average daily attendance calculation and introduces new funding add-ons for county offices of education that operate juvenile court schools and county community schools, as well as establishing a Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant. These changes, effective beginning in the 2023–24 fiscal year, will directly affect funding, reporting, and compliance processes in local education agencies and indirectly impact others included in the overall local control funding formula.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts will experience changes in funding allocations through revised average daily attendance calculations. Specifically, when pupils enrolled in county-operated programs generate attendance, the attendance is credited to the student’s district of residence, potentially shifting expected funding levels. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education will receive additional $200,000 add-ons for each juvenile court school and county community school they operate. They are also responsible for administering a new Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant of $3,000 per unit of ADA, necessitating enhanced reporting and compliance measures. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: Although Charter Schools are not directly targeted by the changes, they are included in the overall local control funding formula. Adjustments in the calculation of average daily attendance and shifts in funding priorities may indirectly affect their state funding levels.

                           The bill increases the add-on funding provided through the local control funding formula from $200,000 to $300,000 (an increase of $100,000) starting with the 2023–24 fiscal year. This change directly affects School Districts that receive differentiated assistance and the County Office of Education responsible for administering these funds. Affected local agencies will need to update their budgeting, allocation, and reporting processes to comply with the revised funding formula.

                           The legislative change revises California state law by increasing the add-on funding for the Los Angeles County Office of Education from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 for antibias professional development and, concurrently, appropriates $3,500,000 from the General Fund for county offices of education to purchase and maintain emergency opioid antagonists for local educational agencies. This change directly impacts the County Office of Education and indirectly affects School Districts and Charter Schools by imposing new compliance and coordination requirements beginning with the 2023–24 fiscal year.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       
                           The legislative change revises the California School Finance Authority Act by altering the mechanism through which participating parties can trigger local intercepts for school finance projects. Specifically, it allows a participating party to request that a county treasurer or fiscal officer execute an apportionment or revenue transfer. It also restricts the power of school districts and county offices of education with qualified or negative financial certifications by limiting their ability to intercept payments only to cases where repayment is probable.
                       
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts will now be limited to intercepting payments only for indebtedness where repayment is deemed probable, which may require adjustments in their financing practices and internal compliance reviews.
County Office of Education: County offices of education with qualified or negative financial certifications will have their authority to intercept payments limited to those situations where repayment is likely, necessitating a review and potential adjustment of their financial certification processes.
County: County treasurers or other fiscal officers are now required to receive and process local intercept requests from participating parties. If a county agrees to participate, these officials must execute revenue transfers or apportionments, introducing new operational responsibilities.

                           The legislative change updates the state apportionment and local control funding formula for agencies affected by emergency-induced declines in average daily attendance. For the 2022–23 fiscal year, school districts must receive an additional appropriation equal to 12.5% of the difference computed for the 2020–21 fiscal year. While school districts face direct funding allocation adjustments, charter schools and county offices of education remain indirectly impacted by existing certification and documentation requirements that support attendance-based funding formulas.

                       School District: School districts will have a new appropriation for the 2022–23 fiscal year equal to 12.5% of the amount difference calculated (based on the 2020–21 figures) due to emergency-related attendance declines. This adjustment requires the district to certify attendance records and submit affidavits to document that the decline was emergency-driven. (Deadline: July 01, 2022)
Charter School: Charter schools remain subject to the existing local control funding formula. Although the 12.5% allocation change specifically targets school districts, charter schools must continue to maintain accurate attendance records and provide the necessary documentation if affected by emergencies.
County Office of Education: County offices of education, which play a role in measuring average daily attendance for state apportionment purposes, must ensure that proper documentation is maintained. They may also need to coordinate with school districts to support the affidavits required to demonstrate emergency-related attendance declines.

                           The legislative change extends the encumbrance period for a $15,000,000 appropriation—from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2025—designated to support the county office of education in curating a repository of high‐quality open educational resources for local educational agencies. This extension impacts both the agency directly tasked with repository development and, indirectly, the agencies that will eventually use these resources.

With the extended encumbrance period until June 30, 2025, this agency must update its project timelines and ensure funds are properly utilized according to state guidelines and reporting requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
School District: School districts, as key local educational agencies, will benefit from improved access to high-quality open educational resources curated under the program. While no direct compliance measures are imposed on them, coordination with the county office of education may be necessary to integrate these resources into their curricula.
Charter School: Charter schools will indirectly benefit from the enhanced availability of open educational resources. They should remain informed about the repository’s progress and any coordination efforts required with their authorizing school districts or the county office of education.

                           The legislative change revises state funding for zero-emission schoolbus programs by eliminating prior multi-year appropriations and instead providing one-time grant funding for the 2023–24 fiscal year. This impacts local educational agencies by altering the amount and duration of available funding for schoolbus replacement and associated charging/fueling infrastructure. Affected agencies must adjust their capital planning, rework fleet replacement schedules, and comply with new grant application protocols.

                       School District: Local school districts, as primary local educational agencies owning schoolbuses, face a shift from recurring annual grant awards to a one-time funding opportunity in 2023–24. They must accelerate planning, update fleet replacement strategies, and align infrastructure projects with the new, lower total funding allocations.
Charter School: If charter schools qualify as local educational agencies under state definitions, they may be eligible for grant funding for zero-emission schoolbus replacement and related infrastructure. They need to verify eligibility and, if applicable, adapt their planning to the one-time funding opportunity.

                           This legislative change clarifies that if the Commission on State Mandates determines that a bill imposes costs mandated by the state, local agencies and school districts are entitled to reimbursement under established statutory procedures. Affected agencies must document the costs they incur due to state mandates and follow the procedures set forth in Part 7 of Division 4, Title 2 of the Government Code. This change may have both direct and indirect financial impacts on various local agency types, requiring enhanced compliance and documentation efforts.

County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, serving local school districts, may incur costs from state mandates and will be required to comply with established procedures to obtain reimbursement.
City: Cities that face state-mandated cost increases must be prepared to document these expenses and follow the legal reimbursement process should the Commission determine such costs exist.
County: Counties, as local governmental entities, will need to track any costs resulting from state mandates and claim reimbursement in accordance with state law if costs are confirmed.
Special District: Special districts that incur extra costs due to state mandates must adhere to the statutory process for reimbursement once those costs are officially recognized.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, formed by multiple agencies to exercise common powers, may also be affected by state mandates and will need to coordinate internally to document costs and file for reimbursement.

                           The bill appropriates funds to help school districts and community college districts meet the constitutional minimum funding requirements under Section 8 of Article XVI. This change will likely adjust how these agencies budget, report, and account for state funds, with potential compliance reviews and updates to financial procedures.

                       School District: School districts will receive a portion of the appropriated funds to meet constitutional funding minimums. This requires revising budgeting procedures and financial reporting practices to ensure that the new funds are properly applied and compliant with state mandates.
Community College: Community colleges will also have funds directed toward meeting the minimum funding thresholds. They must adjust their financial planning and reporting systems to reflect the application of these funds and to maintain compliance with constitutional requirements.

                           The legislative change expands the California Prekindergarten Planning and Implementation Grant Program by authorizing the State Department of Education to allocate unexpended or returned funds to support costs related to the professional development and credentialing of educators in preschool, transitional kindergarten, and kindergarten programs. This change affects local educational agencies by expanding the list of allowable expenditures under the program, requiring updated financial tracking, revised reporting protocols, and enhanced compliance measures.

                       School District: School Districts, as primary local educational agencies, will potentially receive additional funds from unexpended or returned grant monies. These funds must be used for covering educational expenses such as professional development, credential attainment, and related costs for preschool, transitional kindergarten, and kindergarten educators. Districts will need to update budgeting, tracking, and reporting procedures to comply with the new guidelines.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education will play an enhanced role in administering and monitoring the allocation process. They must ensure that School Districts adhere to the new requirements for using funds for educator credentialing and professional development in early childhood education.

                           The legislative change amends the requirements under the After School Education and Safety Program. It mandates that a local educational agency – typically a School District – that contracts with a third party to run before and after school programs must include contractual provisions requiring the third party to notify the agency of health or safety issues and to request pupil health information from parents or guardians. While the direct impact is on School Districts, cities and counties involved in grant applications or partnerships with school districts may also experience indirect effects as they coordinate program oversight and compliance.

City: Cities that apply for grants or partner with School Districts under the program may need to adjust their oversight and collaborative practices to align with the new contractual requirements imposed on the School District.
County: Counties involved in the program as grant applicants or partners with School Districts could be indirectly impacted by the new requirements, necessitating updates to their oversight mechanisms and collaboration frameworks.

                           The legislative change amends Education Code Section 35186 to expand the uniform complaint process used by school districts. Instead of addressing teacher misassignment complaints only when a teacher lacking credentials is assigned to a class with more than 20% English learner pupils, the updated process now applies if the teacher is assigned to any class with one or more English learner pupils. This effectively broadens the scope of complaints, imposing a state-mandated local program that requires updates to internal policies and administrative procedures.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must update and expand their uniform complaint process to address teacher misassignment complaints under the new criteria. They are now obliged to investigate any instance where a teacher lacking proper credentials or training is assigned to teach even a single English learner pupil, as opposed to the previous threshold of over 20%. This change increases the administrative and oversight burden on districts.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide services and guidance to school districts, may need to offer additional support and advisory resources to assist districts in implementing the revised complaint process and ensuring compliance.
Charter School: Charter schools, although independently operated, are often overseen by local school districts. Changes in the district’s uniform complaint process may indirectly affect charter schools if they are required to align with or adopt similar internal procedures for addressing teacher misassignment issues.

                           The legislative change modifies California’s teacher credentialing process by introducing two key measures: (1) requiring the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to issue comparable preliminary credentials to eligible military service members and their family members (including surviving spouses/domestic partners) based on a valid out-of-state professional credential, with the credential limited to the period of active military orders; and (2) exempting certain preliminary credential candidates from the teaching performance assessment requirement. Although implemented at the state level, these changes indirectly impact local agencies by altering teacher hiring, credential verification, and teacher preparation program requirements.

                       School District: School Districts must update their teacher hiring and credential verification processes to accommodate comparable credentials issued under the new military provisions. They also need to align internal evaluation processes with the exemption from the teaching performance assessment for affected candidates.
Charter School: Charter Schools will need to adjust their recruitment and credentialing practices to include the new comparable credential process and exemptions from performance assessments. This requires integrating the changes into existing policies and ensuring staff are aware of the new standards.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide oversight and guidance to School Districts and Charter Schools, must update their advisory documents and support mechanisms to help local agencies understand and implement the new credentialing provisions.
Community College: Community Colleges offering teacher preparation programs will need to update their curriculum and advising processes to reflect the exemption from the teaching performance assessment for certain preliminary candidates, ensuring future educators are aware of the streamlined pathway to credentialing.

                           The legislative change extends the existing necessary small school funding provisions—originally applied in the 2021–22 and 2022–23 fiscal years—to now include the 2023–24 fiscal year. This means that school districts impacted by a school’s destruction due to a state of emergency can continue to report attendance and full‐time teacher counts as if the destroyed school were operational, thus preserving their funding. In addition, county offices of education may be indirectly impacted as they provide oversight and coordination to ensure compliance with these revised reporting procedures.

                       School District: School districts must adjust their reporting systems to include attendance figures and full‐time teacher counts for schools destroyed by emergencies as if they were still operational during the 2023–24 fiscal year. This adjustment ensures the continuation of necessary small school funding.
County Office of Education: County offices of education will need to update their oversight and administrative protocols to support school districts in accurately implementing and reporting under the extended funding provisions.

                           The new legislative change prohibits the state board from granting waivers for any law or regulation provisions concerning transitional kindergarten and kindergarten admission. Previously, school districts and county boards of education could request waivers under Education Code Section 33050, but now they must strictly follow state requirements. This impacts local educational governance and forces agencies to review and adjust their admission policies accordingly.

                       School District: School districts that formerly used waiver requests to modify or adjust policies related to transitional kindergarten and kindergarten admissions are now required to adhere strictly to state mandates. They must update existing policies since the waiver mechanism is no longer available.
County Office of Education: County Boards of Education, operating under the County Office of Education, lose the ability to request waivers for transitional kindergarten and kindergarten admission laws. This necessitates a review of county-level policies and practices to ensure they fully comply with the state law.

                           The legislative change mandates that public reporting of performance data on state and local indicators be completed by designated dates for the prior school year via the California School Dashboard. This revision requires local educational agencies to adjust their data collection timelines (through the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System) and comply with new reporting deadlines. In effect, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools face additional administrative duties under a state-mandated local program.

                           The legislative change mandates that both school districts and county offices of education must update their website posting requirements for LCAPs. School districts now must post LCAPs approved by both their governing boards and the county superintendent, while county offices of education must post LCAPs approved by the county board of education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. This creates new state-mandated local program duties and requires greater coordination between local and state education officials.

                           This legislative change mandates that county superintendents of schools in counties with a single school district now prepare and submit a summary detailing how they will support local school districts and schools in implementing their LCAP. Previously, this requirement applied only to counties with multiple school districts. As a state-mandated local program, it increases administrative and compliance responsibilities for the affected local agencies.

                       County Office of Education: County superintendents (typically part of the County Office of Education) in single school district counties must now prepare, present, and submit an LCAP support summary to the county board of education. This requirement, previously not applicable to them, increases their administrative workload and oversight responsibilities.
School District: School districts in counties with a single school district may experience indirect effects as increased oversight from the county superintendent could lead to more stringent coordination and review of LCAP support strategies, potentially affecting their operations.

                           The legislative change requires that school districts and county offices of education which meet specified criteria update their Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAP) or annual updates to include specific actions and services for technical assistance aimed at improving pupil outcomes. Essentially, the bill creates a state-mandated local program by imposing additional duties on these local agencies, which could involve revising planning templates, administrative processes, and compliance oversight.

                           This legislative change mandates an extended and augmented technical assistance program for underperforming school districts. Under the new law, county superintendents of schools (operating within County Offices of Education) must provide technical assistance for a minimum of two years to any school district that meets performance criteria based on specified pupil subgroups, and an additional obligation is imposed when school districts fail to submit required data. For districts that continue to meet performance criteria for three or more consecutive years, the school district’s geographic lead agency must collaborate with the county superintendent to deliver technical assistance. This creates new compliance, administrative, and coordination requirements for the involved local agencies.

This adds new administrative duties and potential funding challenges.
School District: School districts that meet certain performance criteria or fail to submit specified data will now automatically trigger a state-mandated technical assistance intervention. Additionally, if these criteria persist for three consecutive years, the district must engage with its geographic lead agency and the county superintendent to implement improvement measures.

                           The legislative change amends Education Code Section 52071.5, requiring the Superintendent of Public Instruction to provide a minimum of 2 years of technical assistance to any County Office of Education that either meets specified pupil subgroup performance criteria or fails to submit required data. This change increases the duration and scope of technical support to ensure proper revision and approval of local control and accountability plans (LCAPs), thereby enhancing compliance oversight.

                       County Office of Education: County Offices of Education are directly impacted. Under the amended law, if a County Office of Education has one or more specified pupil subgroups meeting performance criteria, it must receive a minimum of 2 years of technical assistance from the Superintendent. Additionally, offices that do not submit the required data will trigger the same technical assistance requirement. This mandates a more structured and prolonged state oversight in the LCAP revision process.

These Equity Leads will be responsible for developing and disseminating resources, analyzing programs, and addressing racial disparities, with a special emphasis on schools receiving LCFF Equity Multiplier funding. Additionally, the law appropriates General Fund monies starting in the 2023–24 fiscal year to support these initiatives.

                       School District: Selected school districts serving as Equity Leads must develop and implement programs to mitigate racial disparities, disseminate best practices, and support other local agencies—especially those benefiting from LCFF Equity Multiplier funding. They will also be subject to a competitive selection process and remain accountable for meeting these new equity mandates. (Deadline: March 01, 2024)
Charter School: Charter schools may be selected as Equity Leads or join consortia that serve in that capacity. If selected, they will be required to adopt enhanced oversight procedures, develop resources to tackle racial disparities, and align their practices with the state’s equity initiatives. (Deadline: March 01, 2024)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which already support school districts and charter schools, may be indirectly affected. They will likely need to coordinate with selected Equity Leads and adjust support services to align with the new state-directed equity initiatives. (Deadline: March 01, 2024)

                           The legislative change revises the state intervention process for educational agencies by creating two distinct pathways for school districts and county offices of education. Under the new process, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence must first assess, through consultation with technical assistance providers and the affected agency, whether further assistance is needed. If the agency fails to implement collaborative recommendations or shows persistent/acute underperformance (measured over three out of four consecutive school years), the Superintendent—subject to state board approval—may initiate intervention, which can include mandated changes to the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and budget revisions. Additionally, charter schools are indirectly impacted through an expanded advisory role under the amended provisions.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must now participate in a two-step intervention process. They are required to consult with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, implement its recommendations, and, if deficiencies persist, make mandated revisions to their LCAP and budgets following state board-approved intervention.
County Office of Education: County offices of education face a parallel intervention process requiring engagement with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. Their performance, evaluated via a specific rubric over three out of four consecutive school years, must improve in response to technical assistance, or they risk state-imposed interventions that could mandate changes in LCAPs and budgets.
Charter School: While charter schools are not directly subject to the intervention process, the amended Section 52074 expands the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence&#39;s role to advise and assist charter schools. This may require charter schools to align their operations with updated advisory guidance and recommendations.

                           The legislative change expands the Community Engagement Initiative by requiring that any partnership formed under its provisions must include providing fiscal support to partner organizations. This requirement is designed to boost the capacity for meaningful collaboration among community engagement professional learning networks. As a result, local agencies—primarily school districts and associated education oversight bodies—as well as other local governmental entities that may participate indirectly, will need to update their budgeting processes, partnership agreements, and operational protocols to comply during the 2022–23 through 2026–27 fiscal years.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts, as primary implementers of community schools and the lead in convening community engagement networks, must now incorporate fiscal support for partner organizations. This will require revising budgets, updating partnership agreements, and adjusting operational guidelines.
Charter School: Charter Schools, while not the primary agents for fiscal support, may experience indirect effects if involved in district-led community engagement initiatives. They will need to review and align their administrative and financial practices with the new requirements initiated by partner school districts.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which serve as regional coordinators for school districts, may be required to oversee and assist in the implementation of fiscal support requirements across multiple community engagement networks.
City: Cities in areas where school districts are implementing the initiative might be drawn into interagency partnerships. They could face indirect obligations to review or align local policies and possibly contribute matching fiscal support if engaged as community partners.
County: Counties, as providers of a wide range of local services, may be indirectly affected if their local programs intersect with the Community Engagement Initiative, necessitating closer fiscal and policy alignment with school districts and community organizations.
Special District: Special Districts involved in community services (such as health or housing) could be drawn into partnership arrangements under this initiative. They might need to adjust their budgeting and operational practices if they become a recipient or partner for fiscal support.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities created for multi-agency collaboration may need to revise their interagency agreements to include the new fiscal support requirement, ensuring that all participating entities comply with state mandates.

                           This legislative change imposes a new state-mandated program with two major components affecting local educational agencies. First, local educational agencies serving kindergarten through grade 2 must adopt state‐approved screening instruments to assess pupils for risk of reading difficulties (including dyslexia) and provide timely supports for students identified as at risk. Second, the bill provides significant funding to replace heavy‐duty internal combustion schoolbuses with zero‐emission models, meaning that agencies owning schoolbus fleets must plan for fleet upgrades in accordance with state guidelines.

                       School District: School districts serving pupils in kindergarten through grade 2 must adopt one or more state-approved screening instruments by June 30, 2025, commence annual screening in the 2025–26 school year, and provide necessary supports to pupils identified at risk for reading difficulties. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
Charter School: Charter schools serving kindergarten through grade 2 are required to adopt one or more screening instruments from the state-approved list, perform annual assessments of their pupils, and implement supports for students identified as at risk. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
County Office of Education: County offices of education may need to provide technical assistance, training, and monitoring support to local agencies (such as school districts and charter schools) in implementing the new dyslexia screening program.
School District: School districts that own heavy-duty internal combustion schoolbuses are targeted by the zero-emission bus program funded through a $375 million appropriation. They must review and comply with state guidelines for replacing these buses with zero-emission models over a five-year period beginning in the 2023–24 fiscal year.

                           The new legislation clarifies that interim assessments provided by the Department to local educational agencies must be used solely for instructional improvement, teacher feedback, and parental communication, and expressly prohibits their use in high-stakes decisions such as teacher evaluations or pupil grade promotion and retention. Local agencies must adjust policies and oversight to comply with these mandated uses.

                       School District: School Districts must ensure that interim assessment data is exclusively used to provide timely instructional feedback, assist in teacher professional development, and communicate with parents, and must prevent its use in high-stakes decisions like teacher evaluations or pupil promotion.
Charter School: Charter Schools are required to adhere to the same guidelines as school districts by using interim assessments only for instructional feedback and improvement while avoiding any use in high-stakes determinations.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education must provide oversight and technical support to ensure that school districts and charter schools implement the prohibition on high-stakes use of interim assessments.

                           The legislative change requires local educational agencies to submit individual pupil records to the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CalPADS) following new processes and timelines established by the Department of Education. This state-mandated local program updates existing federal compliance requirements by imposing additional data submission obligations and record retention standards on these agencies.

                       School District: School Districts must now submit individual pupil records under revised state-established processes and timelines to continue meeting federal record retention mandates. This change creates a new compliance obligation as part of a state-mandated local program.
Charter School: As recognized local educational agencies, Charter Schools are required to comply with the new data submission rules for individual pupil records. They must adjust their internal processes to align with the state&#39;s updated guidelines.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, while not directly submitting data, may be impacted indirectly by having to support and oversee compliance efforts within the school districts they serve. This could involve providing technical assistance and ensuring uniform implementation of the new requirements.

                           This legislative change revises the reporting and funding provisions for the Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialists Grant Program. It requires local educational agencies to submit interim reports (in addition to the existing final report) and mandates that these reports be forwarded to an independent evaluation entity. The bill also prohibits the use of these funds to pay the salaries of current literacy coaches and reading specialists, and it expands funding to eligible schoolsites that did not participate in the initial program. Affected agencies must update their reporting systems, adjust budgeting practices, and ensure compliance with the new evaluation and fund allocation rules.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts receiving grant funds must now prepare and submit interim reports as well as the final report (due by June 30, 2027). They must also rework their budgets to ensure that new funds are not used for the salaries of existing literacy coaches or reading specialists and may need to pursue additional funding if eligible under the augmented program. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
County Office of Education: County offices of education, while not direct recipients, may be indirectly impacted as they are expected to assist school districts in navigating the new reporting requirements, ensure proper data collection, and help coordinate compliance efforts with state oversight bodies.
Charter School: Charter schools that operate as independent local educational agencies may become eligible for augmented funding under the revised program. They must also adapt to new reporting requirements and reexamine their budgeting practices, particularly if they previously allocated funds toward literacy personnel salaries.

                           The Budget Act of 2023 appropriates $118,810,000 in federal funds to support the Stronger Connections Grant Program, which is designed to assist local educational agencies in implementing Multi-Tiered Systems of Support. Under the bill, the Superintendent of Public Instruction must award competitive grants—with oversight from the State Board of Education—to eligible local educational agencies. The funding is earmarked to create safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments through integrated academic, behavioral, and social-emotional initiatives. This legislative change directly impacts School Districts and may also indirectly affect Charter Schools and County Offices of Education.

                       School District: School Districts are directly eligible to receive competitive grants to implement Multi-Tiered Systems of Support. They must comply with federal grant requirements and follow oversight procedures mandated by the State Board of Education, ensuring funds are used to create safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments.
Charter School: Charter Schools, if recognized as eligible local educational agencies, may compete for and receive these grants. They will need to align their practices with the Multi-Tiered Systems of Support framework and comply with federal and state oversight requirements.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may be indirectly impacted by serving as coordinators and providers of technical assistance for local agencies in navigating the grant process and ensuring compliance with MTSS implementation guidelines.

                           The bill mandates that the Legislative Analyst’s Office provide, by March 15, 2024, recommendations to revise the local control and accountability plan for county offices of education. Although the bill directs a state office to develop these recommendations, the resulting changes could impose new or modified compliance and reporting requirements on county offices of education, and indirectly affect school districts through altered oversight and coordination practices.

                       County Office of Education: County offices of education may be required to update their local control and accountability plans or adopt alternative reporting mechanisms based on the forthcoming recommendations. This change could mean a revision of internal processes and compliance protocols to align with new state accountability standards.
School District: School districts, while not directly targeted by the bill, may experience indirect impacts if revised county-level accountability processes alter oversight or reporting coordination between county offices and districts.

                           The new legislation establishes the Diverse Education Leaders Pipeline Initiative, directing funding from the 2023–24 fiscal year to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. The program provides grants of up to $30,000 per administrator candidate to local educational agencies—primarily School Districts and potentially Charter Schools—to train, place, and retain diverse, culturally responsive administrators in transitional kindergarten through grade 12. Administrator candidates awarded a grant must sign a written agreement to serve in a public school for at least two school years. The Commission is also required to submit a report on the program by June 30, 2027, a deadline that may indirectly influence further administrative or funding adjustments at local agencies.

Charter School: Charter Schools, as local educational agencies, may also access the grant funding provided by the initiative. They will need to adjust their recruitment and administrative practices to align with the program requirements, including the mandatory service commitment by administrator candidates.

The funds must be used, in consultation with the state board and department of education, to update the distance learning curriculum and instructional guidance for mathematics so as to align with the state-adopted mathematics framework. While the Sacramento County Office of Education is directly impacted, school districts and charter schools in the area may indirectly be affected when they adopt and implement the new guidance.

School District: May eventually be required to adopt and implement the revised distance learning mathematics curriculum and instructional guidance once the County Office of Education finalizes the updates.
Charter School: As independent public schools operating under local authorizers, they may need to assess and integrate the updated distance learning curriculum and instructional guidance into their programs.

                           The legislative change appropriates $7,000,000 for the 2023–24 fiscal year to support local educational agencies that elect to implement evidence‐based restorative justice practices on school campuses. In addition, the Department of Education is required to develop and post these best practices by June 1, 2024. This change creates direct funding and compliance requirements for school districts and indirectly affects charter schools and county offices of education, all of which may need to adjust their disciplinary policies to align with the published standards.

                       School District: School Districts must review the evidence‐based restorative justice best practices posted by the Department of Education and decide whether to adopt them in order to qualify for potential state funding. This may require updating disciplinary policies, training staff, and submitting an implementation plan as part of the funding application process. (Deadline: June 01, 2024)
Charter School: Although not explicitly mentioned, Charter Schools—as local educational agencies—may opt to implement the posted best practices. They will need to ensure their policies align with the new state guidelines to be eligible for any available support and to maintain consistency with district-level restorative justice efforts. (Deadline: June 01, 2024)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education will likely play a key role in assisting School Districts and Charter Schools with interpreting the new guidelines, coordinating implementation efforts, and ensuring compliance with the state’s restorative justice standards.

                           The bill appropriates $20,000,000 from the General Fund for the 2022–23 fiscal year to support the Educator Workforce Investment Grant Program via the State Department of Education. Although the appropriation is made at the state level, the change indirectly impacts local agencies by setting new funding and compliance expectations for professional learning opportunities for educators. Local agencies will likely need to adjust their professional development programs and reporting practices to align with state guidelines.

                           The legislative change increases state funding for school construction and modernization projects under the Leroy F. Green School Facilities Act by raising the appropriation from $1.3 billion to $1.96 billion for the 2023–24 fiscal year and allows up to $15 million in administrative costs to be charged by the Department of General Services. This funding boost directly benefits local school districts and indirectly impacts other local educational agencies by potentially changing project eligibility, proposal requirements, and compliance procedures.
                       
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts will have increased access to funds for new construction and modernization projects and must update project proposals and budgeting, as well as ensure compliance with state guidelines under the acting legislation. They may also need to account for administrative cost charges imposed by the Department of General Services.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education will likely need to support and guide school districts in leveraging the increased appropriation and ensure that local entities meet all compliance and proposal submission requirements.
Charter School: While not the primary target, Charter Schools may be indirectly impacted if the expanded authorized uses allow them to access funds—for example, through eligibility channels coordinated by local authorizing agencies or school districts.

                       School District: School districts receiving allocations under the fund must update their reporting schedule to submit an interim report on December 15, 2024, followed by annual reports, and a final report on December 15, 2029. They must also account for a reduced funding amount. (Deadline: December 15, 2024)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education must comply with the revised reporting timeline and manage the implications of a decreased fund allocation that could affect learning recovery initiatives statewide. (Deadline: December 15, 2024)
Charter School: Charter schools impacted by the fund allocations need to implement new reporting procedures with the first interim report due on December 15, 2024, and prepare for annual compliance while planning for potential financial constraints due to reduced funding. (Deadline: December 15, 2024)
Community College: Community colleges may be indirectly affected if community college districts receive funds from the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund. They need to stay alert for state-level directives and adjust their reporting and financial planning if allocated funds are received. (Deadline: December 15, 2024)

                           The legislative change repeals the requirement for the Controller’s audit guide to include procedures for determining unspent funds associated with Charter School Facilities Program projects, Career Technical Education Facilities Program projects, and hardship-funded projects. While the state will no longer provide these specific audit instructions, local educational agencies must reassess their internal controls and reporting practices to ensure continued compliance with overall funding conditions.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: As the primary local educational agency, a School District that receives funds under these programs will no longer have state-mandated audit instructions to guide the identification of unspent funds. This requires them to develop or update internal auditing and financial reporting processes to ensure proper oversight of funds used in facility projects.
Charter School: Charter Schools involved in the Charter School Facilities Program projects are indirectly affected. Without the state’s standardized audit guidance, these schools must independently assess and adjust financial tracking and compliance measures, often in coordination with their authorizing entities.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide oversight and support to local educational agencies, will need to help ensure consistent compliance across districts. They may need to offer supplemental guidance or develop new oversight protocols in light of the state&#39;s reduced audit instruction.

                           The bill removes transportation funding provisions for school districts that obtain an approved districtwide charter petition, meaning that such districts will no longer receive a transportation allowance nor be required to develop a detailed pupil transportation services plan. The change affects not only the converting school districts but also has indirect implications for charter schools and county offices of education overseeing these districts.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts with an approved districtwide charter petition will lose eligibility for the transportation allowance and will no longer be required to develop a transportation services plan. This impacts their budgeting, planning, and overall service delivery for pupil transportation. (Deadline: July 01, 2022)
County Office of Education: County offices, which include the county superintendent of schools, may see changes in transportation funding formulas and oversight responsibilities as school districts in their jurisdiction convert to charter status, thereby altering regional planning and funding allocations.
Charter School: Local educational agencies converting to charter schools will transition away from the established transportation funding and planning model. As a result, they may need to develop alternative strategies for financing and managing pupil transportation services.

                           The legislative change appropriates $300 million annually from the General Fund, beginning with the 2023–24 fiscal year, for an Equity Multiplier under the Local Control Funding Formula. The funding is allocated on a per-schoolsite basis using the prior year’s adjusted cumulative enrollment, with each eligible schoolsite guaranteed a minimum of $50,000. In addition, the State Department of Education must report annually on pupil outcomes. As a result, local educational agencies must revise budgeting, data collection, and compliance protocols to integrate the new funding mechanism.

                       School District: School districts will receive additional funding based on the new Equity Multiplier formula, ensuring that every eligible schoolsite gets at least $50,000. Districts must adjust budgetary processes, update enrollment data systems, and prepare for enhanced reporting requirements to track pupil outcomes. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: Charter schools, as eligible recipients under the funding formula, will receive allocations based on their adjusted enrollment figures, with a minimum funding threshold per schoolsite. They must update their accounting and data management systems to comply with the new state-mandated reporting on pupil outcomes. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which often function in support of a county superintendent’s office, may be indirectly impacted by the need to assist school districts and charter schools in data collection and reporting. They may also coordinate between local agencies and the State Department of Education to ensure compliance with the new funding and reporting guidelines. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)

                           The revised legislation overhauls the state’s approach to educator assignment monitoring and teacher credentialing. It mandates that the Department provide the Commission with detailed educator assignment data (including assignments filled by individuals with preliminary/clear credentials, intern credentials, permits, waivers, misassignments, and vacancies) and requires that local educational agencies have access to the results. In addition, the Commission’s authority to regulate and sanction local educational agencies that repeatedly misassign educators now expressly applies to charter schools as well as school districts, and it creates new oversight duties for county superintendents. Although some provisions (such as transcript review deadlines) are directed at state agencies, local educational agencies are indirectly impacted via enhanced reporting, potential sanctions, and state-mandated operational changes.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts must now comply with more detailed educator assignment data requirements including reporting on teacher credential types, misassignments, and vacancies. They will also be subject to enhanced oversight and potential sanctions if they are found to be repeatedly misassigning educators.
Charter School: Charter Schools, as part of local educational agencies, are now included under the Commission’s expanded regulatory authority. They must meet the same detailed educator assignment reporting requirements and face potential sanctions for consistent misassignment of educators.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, through their county superintendents, face new duties requiring annual school inspections and the compilation of reports that include all non‐alternative schools failing to meet updated certification criteria. This constitutes a new state-mandated local program that will require enhanced operational procedures.

                           The bill amends the way fees collected for tests, examinations, or assessments are handled by the Teacher Credentialing Commission. Instead of depositing those fees into a separate Test Development and Administration Account subject to fee reduction requirements during surpluses, the funds will now be deposited directly into the Teacher Credentials Fund and will be exempt from fee reduction mandates. While the change targets state-level financial management and budgetary processes for teacher credentialing, local agencies may feel indirect impacts through shifts in teacher recruitment, certification cost burdens, and potential adjustments in hiring and budget planning.

                           The legislative change revises the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program by introducing new licensing requirements, adjusting fund expenditure schedules, and establishing reporting and compliance procedures for local educational agencies. These changes affect agencies that directly operate K-12 programs and charter schools, and they may also indirectly impact oversight bodies like County Offices of Education that coordinate resource and referral services.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts that operate expanded learning programs must update their program plans to satisfy new licensing requirements, especially when contracting with third-party providers for off-campus program operations. They must also adjust funding expenditure schedules to align with the extended expenditure periods set by the bill.
Charter School: Charter Schools, as local educational agencies, are authorized to use state funds for expanded learning opportunities over an extended fiscal period. They must comply with the new licensing requirements if they contract third parties to operate off-campus programs, requiring a review of existing contracts and internal policies.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may be indirectly impacted through their role as resource and referral agencies. The bill’s requirement for the State Department of Education to distribute a compiled list for data collection means that these offices will need to coordinate with local educational agencies to review and incorporate program access data.

                           The legislative change delays key requirements for transitional kindergarten programs in California. Both School Districts and Charter Schools must now adjust to a later start for maintaining the adult‐to‐pupil ratio (beginning in the 2025–26 school year) and a postponed teacher qualification deadline (extended to August 1, 2025). In addition, the bill introduces new provisions for early enrollment in transitional kindergarten—authorizing enrollment under certain conditions, mandating concurrent state preschool offerings (if available), and requiring enhanced reporting—with penalties for noncompliance. Affected agencies must update staffing models, teacher development timelines, enrollment policies, and reporting systems to ensure continued eligibility for state apportionments and to avoid entitlement withholdings.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: The requirement to maintain an average of one adult for every 10 pupils in transitional kindergarten classrooms is delayed until the 2025–26 school year and is no longer contingent on the availability of state funds. School Districts must revise their staffing and budget plans accordingly.
School District: Credentialed teachers who are first assigned to a transitional kindergarten classroom after July 1, 2015 must now meet one of the designated qualification criteria by August 1, 2025, rather than the previous August 1, 2023 deadline. (Deadline: August 01, 2025)
School District: For schools enrolling early enrollment children in transitional kindergarten, new conditions apply. These include maintaining the adult-to-pupil ratio, concurrently offering a state preschool program if applicable, and implementing detailed reporting requirements. Early enrollment children will not count toward attendance until they have reached their 5th birthday, and failure to comply may result in penalties. (Deadline: October 01, 2024)
Charter School: The requirement for maintaining an average of one adult for every 10 pupils in transitional kindergarten classrooms is similarly delayed until the 2025–26 school year for Charter Schools and is now permanent irrespective of appropriations.
Charter School: For Charter Schools, credentialed teachers first assigned to transitional kindergarten classrooms after July 1, 2015 are now required to meet the designated qualification criteria by August 1, 2025. (Deadline: August 01, 2025)
Charter School: Charter Schools offering transitional kindergarten programs that enroll early enrollment children must comply with the new conditions: maintaining the adult-to-pupil ratio, offering a state preschool program concurrently (if not fully subscribed), and adhering to new reporting mandates.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       
                           This legislative change revises charter school approval and renewal provisions. It requires that appeals against denials of charter petitions can only be reversed if both the school district and the county board of education abused their discretion, and it imposes automatic term extensions for charter schools along defined expiration periods. The changes impose new state‐mandated duties on local educational agencies acting as chartering authorities while also altering the timeline for determining funding and restructuring statuses. These modifications affect direct operators of charter schools as well as the school districts and county offices that authorize and oversee them.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: Local school districts, acting as chartering authorities, must update their petition review and appeal processes to ensure that an abuse of discretion is determined by both the district and the county board before a state reversal can occur. They must also integrate new procedures for the automatic 2-year and additional 1-year term extensions for charter schools within specified date ranges.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, involved in reviewing appeals of charter petition denials, must align their decision-making protocols with the new standard requiring evidence of abuse by both the school district and the county board. They may also need to coordinate and provide data for the mandated report on the funding determination process for nonclassroom-based charter schools.
Charter School: Charter schools will receive automatic term extensions as follows: a 2-year extension for terms expiring between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2025, and an additional 1-year extension for terms expiring between January 1, 2024 and June 30, 2027. In addition, for charter schools meeting the acquiring charter school definition, the date when they are no longer regarded as a continuing charter school is extended from July 1, 2025 to July 1, 2026, affecting eligibility for certain funding streams.

                           The bill introduces expedited processes and enhanced reporting for juvenile court and community schools. It mandates that MOUs between local education agencies and county offices include a joint intake evaluation (within 2 business days, extendable to 5 under extraordinary circumstances) and a transition plan transfer (within 2 business days of enrollment) for wards of the court. Additionally, the bill requires the department to report annually on pupil outcomes, contract an independent evaluation (report due by November 1, 2025), and convene a workgroup on special education needs (report due by February 25, 2025). These changes impact local agencies directly responsible for education as well as partners in postsecondary education.

                       School District: School Districts that host or contract with juvenile court schools must update their MOUs to incorporate a joint intake evaluation process and expedited transfer of transition plans for re-enrolled wards, ensuring compliance with the new mandated timelines.
Charter School: Charter Schools that receive transitioned students under these MOUs must align their enrollment and intake processes with the expedited timelines, ensuring that transition plans are fully transferred within the mandated period.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which oversee juvenile court schools, must revise existing agreements to include the expedited intake and transition procedures, convene a workgroup to address the special education needs of affected pupils, and coordinate with county probation departments for postsecondary partnerships.
Community College: Community Colleges may be required to partner with county probation departments and county offices of education to deliver online postsecondary academic and career technical courses to detained juveniles, aligning program offerings with the new state mandates.

                           The legislative change appropriates $3,500,000 from the General Fund for the 2023–24 fiscal year and onward to be managed by the State Department of Education and allocated through county offices of education. This funding is designated to purchase and maintain emergency opioid antagonists (e.g., naloxone) at school sites. Affected local agencies—including school districts, charter schools, and county offices of education—must comply with new operational protocols and funding management requirements to ensure that each middle school, junior high, high school, and adult school site maintains at least two units of the antidote.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       County Office of Education: County Offices of Education will receive allocated funds and bear the responsibility of coordinating the purchase and maintenance of emergency opioid antagonist stocks for school districts and charter schools. They must also manage an allocation of up to $350,000 for administrative costs as required by the bill. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
School District: School districts must ensure that every designated school site (middle school, junior high, high school, and adult school site) maintains a minimum of two units of emergency opioid antagonists. This may require revising emergency response protocols and arranging training for designated personnel. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: Charter schools, which are either independently managed or overseen by local school districts, will receive funding indirectly through county offices of education. They are required to maintain a minimum of two emergency opioid antagonist units at each school site and adhere to operational guidelines set by the county offices. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)

                           The legislative change shifts meal reimbursement for reduced‐price and paid meals from a federal reimbursement model to direct state reimbursement administered by the State Department of Education. This impacts local educational agencies by altering their funding flows and administrative requirements. Affected agencies must now ensure compliance with both federal program participation (School Breakfast and School Lunch Programs) and additional state law requirements to receive funding.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts that provide meals are now required to secure state meal reimbursement for reduced‐price and paid meals, contingent on maintaining eligibility under the federal programs and adherence to state regulations. This represents a shift from direct federal reimbursement to a state-administered process, potentially affecting budgeting and reporting protocols. (Deadline: September 01, 2022)
County Office of Education: County offices of education will now receive state meal reimbursements based on compliance with federal program standards and state regulations. This change requires updates to financial tracking and documentation practices to ensure eligibility for state funds. (Deadline: September 01, 2022)
Charter School: Charter schools participating in the federal meal programs must adjust to the new state reimbursement process. This includes revising budgeting systems and internal controls to align with state documentation and eligibility requirements for receiving funds for reduced-price and paid meals.

                           The legislative change mandates that the Student Aid Commission transmit discrete data to the California College Guidance Initiative. This enhanced data flow will produce educator reports that local educational agencies—specifically school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools—can use to monitor whether individual pupils have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid or California Dream Act Application. Although the primary obligation falls on the state agency, the new reporting mechanism indirectly impacts local agencies by requiring them to update monitoring, compliance, and follow‐up processes.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts will receive enhanced educator reports based on state-provided data. They are expected to integrate these reports into existing systems to track student completion of aid applications and to take corrective actions if discrepancies are found.
County Office of Education: County offices of education, which serve as regional oversight bodies for school districts and charter schools, will use the aggregated educator reports to supervise and support constituent agencies. They will need to coordinate efforts across agencies to ensure student aid application compliance.
Charter School: Charter schools, as local educational agencies, will access the educator reports to verify that their students have completed necessary applications. This will likely require updates to existing monitoring systems and action protocols for addressing missing submissions.

                           The legislative change revises the LCAP requirements under California law, establishing a state-mandated local program that affects how school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools document and act on stakeholder engagement and performance data. In particular, the new provisions require local agencies to include, in their LCAPs commencing with the 2024–25 cycle, a detailed summary of stakeholder engagement (including for schools generating Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier funding), specific corrective actions when a school or pupil group earns the lowest performance on state indicators, and clearly defined performance goals for multiplier-funded schools.

                       School District: School districts must update their LCAPs to incorporate an enhanced stakeholder engagement summary, corrective measures for low-performing schools/pupil groups, and specific performance goals for schools receiving Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier funding. This imposes new compliance and reporting obligations that affect internal planning and oversight. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
Charter School: Charter schools are required to hold public hearings and adopt updated LCAPs that reflect the revised state-mandated instructions. These updates include detailed documentation of stakeholder engagement and performance-based interventions, with changes effective for the 2024–25 LCAP cycle. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
County Office of Education: County Offices (through county boards of education and superintendents) must ensure that the LCAPs submitted include the updated instructions on stakeholder engagement and performance remedial actions. This indirectly impacts their administrative processes and oversight functions, particularly for schools receiving multiplier funding. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)

                           The legislative change imposes new reporting and presentation requirements on local educational agencies. It expands the content of the local control funding formula budget overview—particularly for county offices of education by requiring detailed reporting of add-on funding for juvenile court schools, county community schools, and the Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant—and shifts the procedural timeline and audience for LCAP updates. These changes affect School Districts, Charter Schools, and County Offices of Education by mandating revised processes and new deadlines for report submission and presentation.

                           The legislative change expands the current public school accountability system by specifically requiring that both English learners and long-term English learners be measured separately. This expansion creates new obligations for local educational agencies to update systems for data collection, reporting, and evaluation of student subgroups. The change is likely to impose additional administrative duties and oversight responsibilities, effectively constituting a state-mandated local program.

                       School District: School districts must modify their data collection and reporting systems to separately track long-term English learners, in addition to the existing category of English learners. This update will require the adoption of new evaluation rubrics and may involve additional staff training and oversight processes.
Charter School: Charter schools, as part of the public school accountability system, are required to adhere to the amended measures by separately tracking long-term English learners. They will need to revise their reporting procedures and ensure compliance with the new state standards.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education must support and oversee local districts and charter schools to ensure these entities comply with the updated accountability measures. This includes coordinating efforts, offering technical assistance, and verifying that new reporting requirements are met.

                           This legislative change revises how technical assistance services provided by the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence are accessed and funded. It limits requests to only those school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that meet designated eligibility criteria for technical assistance. Additionally, it authorizes a county-level entity—the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team—to request these services and establishes that they, too, must reimburse costs pursuant to the annual Budget Act. Affected local agencies must review eligibility requirements and update reimbursement protocols accordingly.

                       School District: School districts must now verify that they meet specific eligibility criteria for technical assistance before requesting help from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, and if approved, they must reimburse for the cost of these services in line with the annual Budget Act.
County Office of Education: County offices of education are required to confirm their eligibility for technical assistance before requesting services, and upon doing so, they must reimburse costs as specified by the annual Budget Act.
Charter School: Charter schools must now meet defined eligibility criteria to access technical assistance. If eligible, they are obligated to reimburse the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence for the services provided.
County: The County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team—a county-level entity—is newly authorized to request technical assistance. This team will also be subject to the reimbursement requirement under the annual Budget Act.

                           This legislative change broadens the objectives of the Bilingual Teacher Professional Development Program by requiring that professional development support additional languages (including Spanish, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, and Arabic) and intensifying oversight through quarterly meetings between the department and grant recipients. The bill also amends funding appropriations and extends reporting deadlines. As a result, local agencies eligible for these grants must update their bilingual education programs and comply with new reporting and participation requirements.

                           The legislative change expands CCGI service eligibility from solely school districts to all local educational agencies and mandates revisions to annual parent notifications. Affected agencies must now include explicit information on the additional use of CalPADS and CCGI data as required by the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, thereby introducing both an opportunity for expanded services and a new compliance obligation.

Charter School: Charter schools are now recognized as local educational agencies eligible for CCGI services. They must update their notification procedures to include the new mandated disclosures regarding CalPADS and CCGI data usage.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, now authorized to access CCGI services, are impacted by the need to amend their annual notifications. They must incorporate details about the additional use of CalPADS and CCGI data in order to remain compliant with federal law.

                           The legislative change reduces the state appropriation for certain charter schools for the 2022–23 fiscal year from $413,000,000 to $290,023,000. This funding reduction directly impacts Charter Schools and may also indirectly affect County Offices of Education, which play a role in administering and overseeing such funds. Affected agencies will need to reassess their budgets, modify funding allocations, and adjust operational plans to comply with the revised funding levels.

                       Charter School: Charter Schools receiving state funds via the Superintendent will face a reduction in appropriations by approximately $122,977,000. This decrease may force these schools to adjust their operating budgets, delay or cut planned programs, and reallocate resources to align with the lower funding level.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which often play a key role in the distribution and oversight of charter school funds, may need to revise their funding distribution formulas and administrative processes. This adjustment ensures that the rippling effects of the funding reduction are managed effectively.

This includes aligning regional policies with the updated state criteria and ensuring effective oversight of fund expenditures.
Charter School: Charter Schools receiving funding under the appropriations must update their operational procedures to comply with the revised definition of freshly prepared onsite meals and new best practices. They are required to ensure that any expenditures on kitchen infrastructure and meal program improvements meet the updated criteria.

                           The legislative change reduces the block grant appropriation for the Arts, Music, and Instructional Materials program by $200 million for the 2022–23 fiscal year. This reduction impacts local agencies that receive funding through the State Department of Education, directly affecting School Districts, Charter Schools, and County Offices of Education by lowering available funds for professional development, instructional materials, and arts and music initiatives. Local agencies will need to reassess their budgets, update program plans, and comply with any revised state reporting or allocation guidelines.

                       School District: School Districts receiving block grant funds will see a decrease in financial resources allocated for arts, music, and instructional materials. This necessitates a review of existing budgets, possible program cutbacks, and adjustments in how these funds are distributed internally.
Charter School: Charter Schools that depend on the block grant for arts, music, and instructional materials will face a reduction in funding. This change may prompt a detailed financial impact analysis and the need to rework operational plans to sustain program quality.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education responsible for allocating block grant funds to local school districts and charter schools must update their distribution formulas and overall planning processes. The funding reduction will require a reexamination of county-wide budget strategies and possible revisions in fund distribution methods.

This could involve updating internal compliance processes based on the evaluator’s recommendations regarding the use of California School Dashboard data.
Charter School: Charter Schools, through their authorizers, might be indirectly affected by any changes in technical assistance programs resulting from the evaluation. They should be prepared for potential adjustments in reporting requirements or compliance standards that could alter current operational practices.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which support and oversee local school districts and charter schools, may need to coordinate changes in technical assistance delivery and data collection practices if the evaluation identifies areas for improvement.

                           The legislative change directs $1,000,000 from the General Fund for the 2023–24 fiscal year to be awarded as a grant to the community-based organization Beyond Differences. The purpose is to support local educational agencies in implementing high-quality integrated academic, behavioral, and social–emotional learning practices. Although the bill acts at the state level, its provisions filter down to local agencies who may receive support, need to adjust policies, and report on implementation outcomes.

                       School District: School Districts may benefit from the additional state support but are expected to adopt integrated academic, behavioral, and social–emotional learning practices. They will need to update policies, potentially apply for guidance, and comply with any reporting requirements tied to the grant. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: Charter Schools, as local educational agencies, may also access support through this initiative. They will need to align their academic and behavioral policies with the integrated learning approach and meet any compliance or reporting standards linked to the grant program. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide regional support to school districts and charter schools, may be required to coordinate and assist in the implementation of the new integrated practices. This includes facilitating technical support and ensuring local agencies understand the new grant requirements. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)

                           The legislative change extends an existing funding exemption by making the state’s proration formula for allocating support funds inapplicable for the 2023–24 fiscal year. Under current law, this exemption was already in place for fiscal years 1992–93 to 2022–23. As a result, local agencies that traditionally rely on these state apportionment calculations for school districts and community colleges will need to adjust their budgeting and financial planning processes in anticipation of a different funding allocation method.

                       School District: School districts will no longer receive funding based on the previously mandated proration formulas for 2023–24, which may result in adjustments to budget projections and resource planning.
Community College: Community colleges (or community college districts) will similarly be affected as the proration calculations used for allocating state support funds are inapplicable for 2023–24, requiring revisions to their financial planning processes.

                           The legislative change expands the Golden State Teacher Grant Program by including California preschool programs as eligible service sites and by extending the time allowed for students to complete their teacher preparation (and credential) from 3 to 6 years. While administered by state agencies, these changes indirectly affect local public agencies that operate or oversee K-12 and preschool programs, requiring them to review and update their policies, service tracking, and teacher placement processes.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts, which operate priority schools and may run preschool programs, will need to adjust internal policies and tracking mechanisms to accommodate the expanded eligibility for preschool service sites, the extended 6-year period for teacher preparation completion, and the revised method for counting service at schools from the priority list.
Charter School: Charter Schools that are designated as priority schools or that offer preschool programs may need to modify recruitment and service verification processes to align with the new program provisions.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, in their role of overseeing school districts, must assist with the coordination of updated teacher service requirements and ensure that local districts are informed about the expanded preschool program criteria.
City: Cities that operate or sponsor public preschool programs will need to review and potentially adjust their oversight and employment verification processes to ensure these programs meet the new service requirements.
County: Counties responsible for local educational oversight may have to integrate the revised teacher service and placement standards into their broader education strategy, particularly if they run or support preschool programs within their jurisdiction.
Special District: Special Districts that deliver educational or preschool services might be affected if their programs are counted among priority service sites, necessitating a review of service tracking and compliance requirements.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities involved in managing shared educational services may face indirect impacts through coordinated teacher service requirements, which will require them to update compliance and coordination strategies across participating agencies.

                           The legislative change updates the wage overpayment recoupment provisions applicable to school employers. It mandates that employers, such as school districts and charter schools, provide written notice to employees of overpayments, include specified rights in such notices, and revise payroll deduction practices—particularly by disallowing full repayment through payroll deductions for overpayments that occurred more than one year previously. In cases of disputed overpayment amounts, the employer must now initiate legal proceedings or obtain a binding arbitration decision before recouping funds. Additionally, if these new provisions conflict with a memorandum of understanding that was in effect on July 31, 2022, that MOU will continue to control until its expiration or renewal.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must revise their wage recoupment procedures. This includes issuing detailed written notifications to employees regarding overpayments and their rights, updating payroll deduction practices by eliminating full repayment through deductions for overpayments older than one year, and instituting a process for disputes that requires legal or arbitration validation. Districts must also review any controlling MOUs in effect as of July 31, 2022.
Charter School: Charter schools, as independent school employers, are required to adjust their internal policies to comply with the new provisions. They must implement written overpayment notifications, modify payroll deduction procedures (especially for overpayments beyond one year), and adopt procedures for initiating legal or arbitration actions when an overpayment is disputed.
County Office of Education: Although not typically a direct school employer, county offices of education may be required to provide guidance and oversight to local school districts and charter schools. They should assist with reviewing and updating policies to ensure alignment with the amended statutory requirements, particularly in jurisdictions where they have administrative or supervisory roles.

                           This legislative change revises the Teacher Residency Grant Program by expanding the placement requirement for residency candidates to serve at any public school in California, increasing the grant amount from $25,000 to $40,000, mandating a minimum compensation package of $20,000 for residency candidates for awards given during/after the 2023–24 fiscal year, and extending the evaluation report deadline to December 1, 2029. These changes will indirectly impact local public agencies by requiring them to adjust hiring practices and coordination with residency programs.

                       School District: Residency candidates are no longer limited to schools within the grant recipient’s jurisdiction, which may increase candidate mobility. School Districts must adjust their hiring and onboarding practices, coordinate with residency program grant recipients, and potentially modify employment terms to align with the new statewide placement and compensation requirements.
Charter School: As public schools eligible for residency candidate placements, Charter Schools will need to review and possibly revise their employment policies and compensation arrangements to ensure adherence to the minimum compensation package requirement and the broader placement mandate.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which serve as regional support agencies, will likely need to provide guidance, technical assistance, and oversight to School Districts and Charter Schools to help them implement the statewide residency placement and new compensation standards.

                           The legislative change narrows the criteria for exempting students with exceptional needs from coursework by limiting the exemption to those who entered 9th grade in the 2022–23 school year or later. It also revises the alternative diploma pathway eligibility. This directly impacts School Districts, and indirectly affects Charter Schools and County Offices of Education, requiring policy updates, administrative adjustments, and staff training to ensure compliance with the new Education Code provisions.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts must update their exemption policies so that only students with exceptional needs who entered 9th grade in the 2022–23 school year or later receive an exemption from additional coursework. They must also revise the criteria for the alternative diploma pathway in line with the amended Education Code.
Charter School: Charter Schools subject to state graduation requirements and alternative diploma pathways need to align their own policies with the new eligibility criteria for exceptional needs exemptions. This may require reviewing current practices and adjusting admissions and graduation protocols accordingly.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may need to issue updated guidance and support to School Districts and Charter Schools regarding the interpretation and implementation of the revised exemption and diploma pathway criteria.

They must also ensure that all special education local plans they submit are posted on the department’s website and adjust their funding allocation processes for the 2023–24 fiscal year according to the new formula. (Deadline: July 01, 2026)
Charter School: If a charter school is a member of a special education local plan area, it will be indirectly impacted by the new funding formula requirements for the 2023–24 fiscal year.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide regional services to school districts, may be affected through their oversight and involvement in the funding allocation process for special education local plan areas.

                           This legislative change mandates that, by June 30, 2024, the Director of Finance must determine the revenue distributions for special education programs among local educational agencies. An appropriation from the General Fund will be made to augment the Budget Act of 2023 item for special education funding, but only to the extent that revenues fall short of an estimated benchmark. If revenues exceed the estimate, the augmentation will be reduced. This creates direct funding and compliance impacts for agencies involved in special education service delivery.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts operating special education programs will experience a direct impact to their funding. They will receive additional appropriations if revenue distributions from successor agencies fall short of the estimated amount. Conversely, if the actual revenues exceed the estimate, the additional funding will be reduced, affecting district budgeting and planning. (Deadline: June 30, 2024)
Charter School: Although Charter Schools are not the primary recipients under the term &#39;local educational agencies,&#39; they may be indirectly affected. Funding adjustments to authorizing School Districts could alter the resources allocated for special education services provided by Charter Schools. (Deadline: June 30, 2024)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide regional support to school districts, may need to adjust their oversight and administrative processes. They will play a role in helping districts comply with the new revenue determination and funding adjustment requirements for special education programs. (Deadline: June 30, 2024)
