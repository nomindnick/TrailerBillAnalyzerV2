                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change requires the Secretary of Transportation to work with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify available state funds that can support grade separation projects at risk of losing local and federal funding. Although the bill targets state-level funding mechanisms, its effects may filter down to local agencies by altering funding commitments and necessitating improved coordination between local and state entities.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities with grade separation projects may need to reassess local funding commitments as the state reallocates funds to cover projects at risk of delayed schedules or losing local funding. This could require enhanced coordination with state agencies and adjustments in local budgeting procedures.
County: Counties with transportation projects may be indirectly impacted by the state’s reallocation of funds. This reallocation could require counties to audit their current funding strategies and actively engage with state agencies to realign project priorities.
Special District: Special districts engaged in local transportation services may need to modify their funding mechanisms if state funds are redirected to support grade separation projects. They should ensure compliance with new state allocation procedures and reassess grant and funding strategies.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that oversee transportation initiatives across multiple local jurisdictions may face changes in collaborative funding arrangements. They will need to re-evaluate interagency agreements in light of potential shifts towards state-managed funding for grade separation projects.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program by incorporating funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund into the formula-based component of the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. This expansion requires regional transportation planning agencies—a category which often includes local entities organized as Cities, Counties, Special Districts, or Joint Powers Authorities—to update and submit financial plans and transit operator data in order to access funds in upcoming fiscal years. Local agencies affected must review their compliance, reporting, and data management practices in anticipation of modified distribution guidelines and new submission deadlines.

                       City: Cities participating in regional transportation planning may need to update their financial plans and transit operator data to remain eligible for allocations under the expanded funding program.
County: Counties involved in regional transportation planning must comply with new submission requirements to access funds, including updated financial documentation and transit data reporting.
Special District: Special districts that serve as or participate in regional transportation planning agencies will need to adjust their internal processes to meet the updated reporting obligations for receiving funds.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, which often are created by local entities for coordinated transportation planning, must now comply with additional data submission requirements and be prepared for guideline modifications by the Transportation Agency.

                       The legislative change mandates that the California Department of Transportation annually report on its zero‐emission vehicle acquisitions and performance beginning in 2025, as part of a broader state effort under the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. While the reporting requirements directly target state agencies, local agencies operating government fleets (such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities) are indirectly impacted. These agencies may need to update their fleet procurement policies, plan for transitioning to and maintaining zero‐emission vehicles, and invest in necessary charging and refueling infrastructure, all of which could influence their budgets and operations.

                       City: Cities that manage local government fleets may need to update procurement processes to embrace zero-emission vehicles and install charging/refueling infrastructure, aligning with state transitions and reporting metrics. (Deadline: October 01, 2025)
County: Counties with public service fleets must revise vehicle procurement and maintenance policies to align with the state’s push for zero-emission vehicles, indirectly affecting budgeting and operational planning. (Deadline: October 01, 2025)
Special District: Special Districts that operate specific service fleets may face indirect mandates to meet new emission standards, requiring adjustments in fleet management and potential capital investments for infrastructure.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities managing shared fleets across jurisdictions may need to harmonize their fleet management practices with state reporting and zero-emission vehicle performance standards.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change authorizes the Department of General Services, with the consent of the Department of Motor Vehicles, to enter into a lease-purchase (or lease with an option to purchase) agreement for a build‐to‐suit office facility that will replace the DMV field office in the City and County of San Francisco. The project may include mixed-use elements such as affordable housing and is subject to approval by the Department of Finance, legislative notice requirements, and the Property Acquisition Law. Although the change primarily impacts state agency operations, it will indirectly affect local government agencies in San Francisco by influencing local zoning, planning, infrastructure coordination, and permitting processes.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change revises the funding allocation for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program. Instead of a fixed split of 25% for planning and 75% for implementation, agencies now must work with a flexible model that requires up to 25% of funds to be reserved for planning, with the remainder allocated for implementation. This change affects local agencies that may apply for or partner on these infrastructure projects by altering budgeting, proposal structuring, and compliance with grant application criteria.
                    </p>

                       City: Cities that are eligible to apply for or partner in the pilot program must adjust their project budgets and timelines to accommodate a flexible funding split. The change from a fixed 25/75 ratio to up to 25% for planning may require revisiting existing planning and implementation strategies.
County: Counties involved in local infrastructure projects under this program need to reevaluate how funds are allocated between planning and implementation. This may affect long-term project scheduling and internal approval processes.
Special District: Special Districts that participate in transportation or infrastructure initiatives may experience changes in the amount of funds available for preliminary planning versus implementation, requiring updates to their application and operational strategies.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, which involve multiple local agencies collaborating on infrastructure projects, must realign their joint budgeting agreements and compliance measures in light of the new, flexible funding percentage for planning.

                       The bill appropriates $100,000,000 from the General Fund to support the Active Transportation Program, aiming to boost walking and biking infrastructure. Although the funds are managed at the state level by the Department of Transportation and allocated by the California Transportation Commission, the resulting funding, project guidelines, and deadlines will filter down to local agencies. Cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities may indirectly be impacted as they may become recipients or partners in executing active transportation initiatives. These agencies will need to align their planning and project proposals with state guidelines and adhere to key deadlines.

They will need to coordinate with state DOT and metropolitan planning agencies to develop project proposals that meet state guidelines. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
County: Counties are likely to experience an indirect impact as state funds support regional transportation improvements. They will need to update regional plans and work with state agencies to ensure that local projects comply with new active transportation requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Special District: Special districts responsible for local transit and infrastructure could benefit from the state’s active transportation funding. They must monitor state program updates and prepare compliant project proposals to secure funding. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities—which are established for multi-agency collaboration—may play a role in administering active transportation projects across jurisdictions. They will need to set up collaborative frameworks to ensure that projects meet state requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislation expands the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General’s oversight by requiring reviews of contract adherence for any public or private entity receiving high-speed rail project funds. In practice, local agencies that enter into such contracts—even if indirectly involved—will need to adjust their contracting practices to include mandatory inspector general access provisions, update internal compliance and recordkeeping systems, and revise HR policies to extend whistleblower protections. Potentially affected local agencies include those entering or managing contracts related to high-speed rail funds.

                       City: Cities that contract with or receive high-speed rail project funds must ensure that all contracts and amendments include the required provisions granting inspector general access to records and property, as mandated by the legislation. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
County: Counties involved in projects funded by high-speed rail sources will be required to revise contract templates to incorporate new oversight provisions, and they may face enhanced audit scrutiny from the Inspector General. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
Special District: Special Districts that manage or allocate high-speed rail project funds must adjust contracting practices to integrate the legislatively required provisions, ensuring consistent oversight by the Inspector General. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by multiple local agencies to handle rail-related projects will need to update their contractual language to comply with new oversight requirements and ensure whistleblower protections extend to contractor employees. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)

                       The legislative change amends the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to allow a designated lead applicant agency to apply for a letter of no prejudice. This change permits the agency to use its own funds for port-related projects with the promise of potential future reimbursement—if specific conditions are met. The provision offers greater financial flexibility but comes with strict deadlines, becoming inoperative on 2033-06-30 and repealed on 2034-01-01. Local agencies involved in administering or operating port infrastructure projects are directly or indirectly affected.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change increases the portion of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes in the high‐speed rail project from 2.5% to 5%. Although the change is primarily aimed at streamlining state-level funding for planning, engineering, and management of the rail project, local agencies could experience indirect impacts. These include altered coordination, permitting, and planning processes where high‐speed rail corridors intersect local jurisdictions.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities located along or near the high‐speed rail corridors may need to adjust local zoning and permitting processes and enhance coordination with state rail project management due to changes in administrative funding.
County: Counties within the affected corridors might experience increased planning and intergovernmental coordination requirements as state administrative support is expanded for managing high‐speed rail projects.
Special District: Special Districts that manage local transportation or infrastructure services may face changes due to potential adjustments in state administrative oversight, impacting local service coordination with the rail project.
Joint Powers Authority: If a Joint Powers Authority is formed to facilitate cooperation between state and local entities on the high‐speed rail project, its governance and decision‐making processes may need to be updated to reflect the increased administrative funding.
