                           The bill revises and expands the criteria that law enforcement agencies must satisfy to request an Ebony Alert for missing Black youth. Although the changes directly affect law enforcement and the California Highway Patrol, local agencies—specifically those operating under city and county jurisdictions where local law enforcement resides—will be indirectly impacted. These agencies will need to update their investigative protocols and documentation practices to ensure they have used all available local resources and gathered actionable public information before requesting an alert.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Local law enforcement units operating within city governments must now document that they have exhausted all available local resources and identified actionable public information before requesting an Ebony Alert. This indirect requirement may necessitate updates to internal procedures and enhanced inter-department communication within city agencies.
County: County-level law enforcement agencies, including sheriff’s departments, are indirectly impacted by the new bill. They must revise their investigative protocols to ensure all local assets are leveraged and that relevant actionable information is gathered prior to initiating an Ebony Alert request.

                           This legislative change mandates that the Secretary of Transportation work with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate state transportation program funds to support grade separation projects. While the primary focus is on stabilizing state-level funding for these projects, the change indirectly affects local public agencies—specifically cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities—that participate in or are impacted by these transportation improvements. Local agencies may need to review and adjust their funding commitments, coordinate project timelines, and modify local planning to align with the new state funding priorities.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that host grade separation projects may experience shifts in funding sources as the state intervenes to reallocate funds. This could require cities to review their local funding commitments and coordinate more closely with state agencies to ensure projects continue as planned.
County: Counties involved in local transportation projects may need to reassess budgets and project timelines as state funds are redirected to cover grade separation projects at risk of losing local or federal funds.
Special District: Special districts that deliver specific services such as transportation or infrastructure management may have to adjust existing funding agreements and project strategies to align with the state’s new allocation approach for grade separation projects.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, representing collaborations among multiple local agencies, might need to strengthen interagency protocols to incorporate state funds effectively, ensuring that joint projects are not adversely affected by changes in local funding commitments.

                           The bill expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program by including funds appropriated from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the formula‐based component of the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. As a result, regional transportation planning agencies are now required to update and submit their regional short‐term financial plans and transit operator data in upcoming fiscal years to qualify for these funds. Since many of these regional agencies are organized as Joint Powers Authorities or Special Districts – and because cities and counties often participate in or are affected by regional transportation planning – several local agency types, both directly and indirectly, may face new administrative and compliance burdens.

Special District: Regional transportation planning agencies structured as Special Districts must adhere to the revised guidelines, including updated financial plans and transit operator data submissions, to continue receiving formula-based funding from the new appropriation source.
City: Cities that participate in regional transportation planning or that operate local transit services may face indirect impacts through increased administrative coordination and oversight as regional agencies adjust to the new compliance and reporting requirements.
County: Counties involved in regional transit operations or those contributing to regional transportation planning may be indirectly impacted by the updated reporting and compliance protocols required for accessing new funding streams.

                           The Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation mandates a transition to zero‐emission vehicles for government fleets. While the law sets explicit targets and reporting requirements for state agencies, it also affects local agencies indirectly by influencing procurement policies, fleet management practices, and infrastructure planning for local government fleets. Cities, Counties, Special Districts, and Joint Powers Authorities may need to adjust their strategies to align with these new standards and reporting obligations.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that manage local government fleets will need to update their procurement policies and operational processes to incorporate zero‐emission vehicles, as the regulation targets the transition of medium‐ and heavy‐duty trucks. This may require changes in purchasing practices, fleet replacement strategies, and infrastructure investments for charging/refueling stations. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
County: County-run fleets are indirectly impacted as they will likely need to align their vehicle acquisition strategies with the zero-emission mandates, similar to state agencies. This involves operational planning and budgeting for procuring and maintaining new zero-emission vehicles. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Special District: Special Districts that operate service-specific fleets may face new requirements to transition to zero-emission vehicles. They will need to assess their current fleets and develop plans that comply with evolving state standards, including potential modifications to their facility operations to accommodate new fueling technologies. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, formed by multiple local agencies, must align their collective fleet management practices with the zero-emission requirements. This includes developing joint compliance strategies, integrating data reporting systems, and revising procurement contracts to meet state mandates. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       
                           The legislative change expands the oversight powers of the High-Speed Rail Authority’s Inspector General. In addition to its existing roles, the IG is now required to review or investigate the adherence to contract provisions for any public or private entity receiving high-speed rail project funds. The bill also extends whistleblower protections to employees of these contractors and mandates that all contracts or contract amendments executed on or after July 1, 2024, include provisions granting the IG access to records and property. Although primarily directed at the state-level High-Speed Rail Authority, local agencies that receive high-speed rail project funds or act as contractors (directly or as part of joint entities) may be indirectly impacted by these new compliance and contractual requirements.

                           This legislative change revises the funding allocation formula for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program. Whereas the existing law fixed planning funds at 25% of available funding and implementation at 75%, the new language provides that up to 25% of funds may be set aside for planning, with the balance used for implementation. This change can affect local agencies that participate in or partner with the Department of Transportation on these projects by altering budgeting assumptions and grant application processes.
                       
                    </p>

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       Joint Powers Authority: Local joint powers authorities involved in collaborative transportation projects under the pilot program must adjust their planning and implementation budgeting to account for a flexible planning fund cap of up to 25% instead of a fixed percentage.
City: Cities participating in the pilot program will need to reexamine their project funding plans as the planning phase may receive less assured funding (up to 25%), possibly affecting project scoping and scheduling.
County: Counties that engage with the Department of Transportation on highway conversion projects under the pilot program must plan for potential variability in planning funds, which may impact overall project funding and execution.
Special District: Special districts, especially those managing transportation or infrastructure services, may be indirectly affected by the modified funding split; grants for planning may be lower than previously expected, necessitating adjustments in project scope and financial planning.

                           This legislative change expands funding flexibility for lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program by allowing them to apply for a letter of no prejudice. This letter permits agencies to expend their own funds on eligible port-related projects, with the opportunity for future reimbursement from program moneys provided specific conditions are met. The change is time sensitive, as the provisions become inoperative on 2033-06-30 and are repealed on 2034-01-01. Local agencies that typically manage or operate port and freight projects should review their funding and compliance processes.

                           The legislative change authorizes the Department of General Services—subject to the consent of the Department of Motor Vehicles and the approval of the Department of Finance—to enter into a lease-purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build‐to‐suit office facility that will replace the DMV field office in San Francisco. The project may be developed as a mixed‐use site that integrates affordable housing. Although the change is directed at state agencies, local agencies in San Francisco may experience indirect impacts through revised local planning, zoning and regulatory oversight requirements associated with mixed-use development and affordable housing integration.
                       
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: The project is located within San Francisco and its potential mixed-use character—including affordable housing—may require the City to adjust planning, zoning, and permitting processes. Local regulatory bodies may need to coordinate with state agencies to ensure compliance with local land-use and housing policies.
County: As San Francisco is a consolidated City and County, the County will also be affected. The state-level authorization for a new build-to-suit facility may require the County to engage in oversight mechanisms and financial planning adjustments, particularly if affordable housing components alter local development or funding dynamics.

                           This legislative change raises the cap on administrative spending for high‐speed rail bonds from 2.5% to 5%. Although the change is implemented at the state level, it could indirectly affect local agencies involved in transportation planning, permitting, and coordination with state rail projects. Local agencies such as Cities, Counties, Special Districts, and Joint Powers Authorities may need to review and revise their existing coordination agreements and planning protocols to align with any changes in state project oversight and financing.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities may experience changes in how state-level administrative practices affect local permitting, zoning, and integration of rail stations into municipal infrastructure. They should be prepared to adjust local planning processes as state project timelines and oversight protocols evolve.
County: Counties, often responsible for regional transportation planning and infrastructure coordination, might need to liaise more closely with state agencies due to potential shifts in the project schedules and administrative oversight stemming from the increased administrative fund allocation.
Special District: Special Districts involved in transportation or related local services could be indirectly impacted if the increased administrative spending alters the funding or operational interface between state and local initiatives for rail-related projects.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities created for multi-agency transportation projects may need to revise their operating procedures and coordination protocols as a result of the state’s increased administrative funding, which might influence joint project implementation strategies.

                           This legislative change is an appropriations bill that takes effect immediately in support of the Budget Bill. It does not create new local programs, impose compliance requirements, or alter funding formulas for local agencies. As a result, there are no direct or indirect impacts on local public agencies.
                       
                    </p>
