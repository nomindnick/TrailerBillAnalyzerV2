                           This legislation amends the Ebony Alert system for missing Black youth by expanding and revising the criteria law enforcement agencies must meet before requesting an alert from the California Highway Patrol (CHP). It changes CHP&#39;s role from discretionary to mandatory activation when criteria are met, and requires the CHP to submit a report by July 1, 2027. This impacts local law enforcement agencies operated by cities and counties.

                           This legislation requires the Secretary of Transportation to identify funding for grade separation projects that previously lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. The Transportation Agency must prioritize projects at risk of losing federal/local funding or facing schedule delays. Local agencies with affected grade separation projects may now have a pathway to restore funding, particularly cities, counties, and special districts involved in transportation infrastructure.

                       City: Cities that had grade separation projects with funding reverted by the Budget Act of 2024 may be eligible for newly identified funding sources. This primarily affects cities that sponsor or co-sponsor grade separation projects (road/rail crossings) that lost previous funding allocations. (Deadline: April 30, 2025)
County: Counties that had grade separation projects with funding reverted by the Budget Act of 2024 may be eligible for newly identified funding sources. Counties that sponsor transportation infrastructure projects involving grade separations may need to engage with state agencies to secure replacement funding. (Deadline: April 30, 2025)
Special District: Transportation-focused special districts (such as transit districts or transportation authorities) with grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024 may be eligible for alternative funding identified through this process. (Deadline: April 30, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: Transportation JPAs that sponsor grade separation projects affected by funding reversions in the Budget Act of 2024 may benefit from this new process to identify alternative funding sources. (Deadline: April 30, 2025)

                           This legislation expands the Transportation Agency&#39;s accountability program for transit funding distribution to include funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program&#39;s formula-based component. It extends reporting requirements for regional transportation planning agencies through fiscal year 2027-28, requiring updated short-term financial plans and transit operator data to receive funding. This impacts local agencies that operate transit services or oversee regional transportation planning.

                       Special District: Transit-focused special districts (such as transit districts or transportation authorities) that receive funding through regional transportation planning agencies may be indirectly affected by the expanded accountability program, as they will need to provide updated transit operator data to their regional transportation planning agencies to facilitate funding eligibility. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
County: Counties that serve as or participate in regional transportation planning agencies must submit updated regional short-term financial plans and transit operator data for the 2025-26 fiscal year, and updated transit operator data for 2026-27 and 2027-28 fiscal years to receive program funding. Counties that operate transit services directly will need to compile and submit operational data. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
City: Cities that operate municipal transit services will need to provide updated transit operator data to their regional transportation planning agencies for inclusion in funding requests. Cities that directly receive transit funding through regional formulas will be subject to the expanded accountability requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: Transit-focused JPAs or regional transportation planning agencies formed as JPAs must comply with the expanded reporting requirements, including submitting updated financial plans and transit operator data to maintain funding eligibility. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)

                           This bill requires the California Department of Transportation to annually report to the Legislature about its zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) purchases, ownership, and leases beginning October 1, 2025 through January 1, 2036. The bill requires performance analysis of acquired ZEVs and reporting on charging/refueling infrastructure. While the bill itself only creates reporting requirements for a state agency, it indirectly impacts local agencies already subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation referenced in existing law.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that maintain vehicle fleets are already subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation for transitioning to zero-emission vehicles. The data collected and analyzed through this state reporting requirement may inform future regulatory changes, implementation timelines, or best practices that could affect local fleet transition requirements.
County: Counties maintaining medium and heavy-duty truck fleets are subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. The performance analysis data from state fleet vehicles may provide valuable information for county fleet planning and infrastructure development.
Special District: Special districts with vehicle fleets (such as water districts, transit districts, etc.) are subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. The state&#39;s reporting on ZEV performance and infrastructure could inform special district planning for their own fleet transitions.
School District: School districts managing bus fleets and maintenance vehicles are subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. The state&#39;s performance analysis of ZEVs could provide useful data for school districts planning their own transitions to zero-emission buses and service vehicles.

                           This legislative change modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation from a fixed 25% for planning and 75% for implementation to &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning and the remainder for implementation. This gives Caltrans more flexibility in how grant funds are allocated between planning and implementation activities, potentially affecting local agencies that partner with Caltrans for highway conversion projects.

                       City: Cities that apply for or participate in the Reconnecting Communities program will be affected by the more flexible funding allocation. Cities may see less funding available for planning activities and more for implementation, depending on how Caltrans chooses to allocate funds. This could impact cities&#39; ability to secure planning grants but may increase implementation funding opportunities.
County: Counties involved in highway conversion projects through the Reconnecting Communities program will experience changes in how funds are allocated between planning and implementation. This flexible allocation could affect counties&#39; project planning and implementation strategies.
Special District: Transportation-related special districts eligible for Reconnecting Communities grants may see changes in available funding between planning and implementation phases, potentially affecting their approach to highway conversion projects.
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs focused on regional transportation planning or implementation that participate in this program will be affected by the more flexible funding allocation between planning and implementation activities.

                           This legislative change appropriates $100,000,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation to support the Active Transportation Program (ATP). The funds will be allocated by the California Transportation Commission, available for allocation until June 30, 2027, and for encumbrance and liquidation until June 30, 2030. This creates significant new funding opportunities for local agencies to implement active transportation projects like bike lanes, pedestrian infrastructure, and safe routes to schools.

                           This legislative change increases the percentage of bond proceeds from the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act that can be used for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5%. While primarily an internal state administrative change, this could potentially have minimal indirect impacts on certain local agencies that coordinate with the high-speed rail project.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities along the high-speed rail route may experience minor indirect impacts if the reallocation from project costs to administrative costs affects project implementation, timelines, or scope in ways that influence local planning or coordination efforts.
County: Counties along the high-speed rail route may experience minor indirect impacts if the reallocation affects project implementation in ways that influence local planning, transportation systems, or economic development initiatives tied to the rail project.
Special District: Transportation-related special districts that interface with the high-speed rail project may experience minor indirect impacts if project implementation changes affect their own service planning or infrastructure coordination.
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs formed for regional transportation planning or coordination may need to adjust their activities if high-speed rail project implementation changes as a result of the increased administrative allocation.
