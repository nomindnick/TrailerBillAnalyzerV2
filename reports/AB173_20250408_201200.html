                           The legislative change expands the criteria that law enforcement agencies (often operating under city or county governments) must meet before requesting an Ebony Alert for missing Black youth. Agencies must now determine that all available local resources have been used and that there is information which, if publicly disseminated, could assist in a safe recovery. Additionally, once the CHP concurs with the determination, activation of the alert becomes mandatory. This change indirectly impacts local agencies by requiring updates to investigative protocols and coordination with state agencies, with a report requirement due by July 1, 2027.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: City law enforcement agencies must update their protocols to ensure that all local resources have been exhausted and that sufficient actionable information is identified before requesting an Ebony Alert. This change requires tighter coordination with state agencies and potential adjustments in emergency response procedures.
County: County law enforcement agencies, such as sheriff&#39;s departments, are required to revise their practices to comply with the expanded criteria for requesting Ebony Alerts. This involves ensuring that all local resources are utilized and that information is available to support the safe recovery of missing individuals.

                       City: Cities with local transportation projects may see changes in funding sources and schedule adjustments as state funds are redirected to support grade separation projects at risk of losing local or federal funding.
County: Counties engaged in roadway and infrastructure projects must prepare for possible shifts in funding, requiring alignment with state processes for supporting grade separation projects previously reliant on local funding.
Special District: Special Districts involved in local transportation or infrastructure services may be indirectly impacted as state funds are reallocated, influencing their funding strategies and project schedules.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that coordinate infrastructure projects across multiple local agencies should be alert to changes in funding allocation which may affect joint projects and require updated interagency coordination.

                           The legislative change expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program to include funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund under the formula-based transit funding component. As a result, regional transportation planning agencies must submit updated financial plans and transit operator data for eligibility across fiscal years 2025–26, 2026–27, and 2027–28. This expanded reporting requirement indirectly impacts local agencies that are typically involved in regional transportation planning, such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities.

                       City: Cities participating in regional transportation planning may be required to update and submit regional short-term financial plans and transit operator data to maintain eligibility for expanded transit funding.
County: Counties involved in regional transportation planning are expected to comply with new submission requirements for financial plans and transit operator data to access funds under the revised accountability program.
Special District: Special districts that serve transportation roles within regional planning frameworks will need to update their financial documentation and submit transit operator data to qualify for the new funding streams.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities managing multi-jurisdictional transit services must adhere to new submission requirements—providing an updated financial plan for fiscal year 2025–26 and transit operator data for fiscal years 2026–27 and 2027–28—to continue receiving funding.

                           The Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation requires government fleets—including those operated by local agencies—to transition to zero‐emission vehicles. While the statute sets state-level mandates for vehicle acquisitions and reporting, local agencies with medium‑ and heavy‑duty trucks (or similar vehicles) are indirectly impacted. Cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities must review and update their fleet procurement, management, and infrastructure plans to align with these evolving standards, even though the immediate reporting obligation falls on the state Department of Transportation.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities operating fleets that include medium- and heavy-duty trucks must update procurement policies to favor zero‑emission vehicles and plan for necessary charging/refueling infrastructure to comply with evolving state mandates. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
County: Counties with government fleets will need to align their vehicle purchasing and fleet management practices with state mandates for transitioning to zero‑emission vehicles, including updating policies and possibly modifying maintenance and operational procedures. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Special District: Special districts, especially those that manage transportation or related services, are indirectly impacted and must adapt their fleet operations, procurement practices, and infrastructure planning in response to new state requirements. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs composed of multiple local agencies will need to coordinate a joint strategy for transitioning their shared fleets to zero‑emission vehicles, ensuring that all member entities align on procurement standards, reporting, and infrastructure investments. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       
                           This legislative change expands the oversight authority of the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General by requiring that all contracts and contract amendments involving high-speed rail project funds, executed on or after July 1, 2024, include specific provisions that grant the Inspector General access to records and property. It further extends whistleblower protections to employees of contractors and clarifies the definition of &#39;personnel issues.&#39; While the change is directed at a state-level authority, local public agencies that enter into contracts with the High-Speed Rail Authority or receive high-speed rail project funds—such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities—may be indirectly impacted by new contract compliance and oversight requirements.

                           The legislative change revises the funding allocation for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program. Previously, 25% of available funds were reserved for planning and 75% for implementation. Under the new provision, up to 25% may be allocated for planning, with the remainder dedicated to implementation. This adjustment affects local agencies that are eligible to apply for competitive grants under this program, requiring them to update proposals, budgeting, and planning procedures to comply with the modified funding criteria.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that participate in transportation projects under the Pilot Program must now adjust project proposals and budgets to account for the flexible planning funding, potentially impacting their planning and implementation strategies.
County: Counties engaging in local transportation initiatives will need to re-evaluate their funding strategies and project proposals due to the change in the set‐aside percentage, affecting both planning and execution phases.
Special District: Special Districts involved in the conversion or transformation of transportation corridors must update their internal processes and project planning to accommodate the revised allocation of funds between planning and implementation.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, often formed by collaborations among local agencies, must revise interagency agreements and operational strategies to align with the new funding parameters, which could affect the joint management of eligible projects.

                           The bill amends the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to allow a lead applicant agency to request a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This letter permits the agency to expend its own funds on approved port-related projects with the possibility of later reimbursement if specified conditions are met. The new provision enhances financial flexibility for local agencies managing port and freight infrastructure projects but is only operative until June 30, 2033 (and fully repealed as of January 1, 2034).

                       City: Cities that manage port-connected infrastructure projects can serve as lead applicant agencies, enabling them to apply for a letter of no prejudice. This allows them to use their own funds upfront with a pathway for future state reimbursement provided they meet certain conditions. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
County: Counties with jurisdiction over port or freight-related projects may act as lead applicant agencies to apply for the letter of no prejudice, facilitating the use of local funds with eventual reimbursement once specific conditions are met. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Special District: Special districts—including port authorities—can utilize the new provision to access state reimbursement for up-front expenditures on port projects by applying as lead applicant agencies and meeting set conditions. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by multiple public agencies can jointly take advantage of the provision. They can coordinate an application for the letter of no prejudice, allowing collaborative pre-funding of port projects with subsequent reimbursement subject to meeting all conditions. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)

                           This legislative change authorizes the state Department of General Services, with DMV consent, to enter into a lease-purchase or option-to-purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility replacing the DMV field office in San Francisco. While the primary action is at the state level, local agencies are indirectly impacted in that the project’s location and mixed-use (including potential affordable housing) component may require local planning, zoning, and regulatory oversight along with coordination on infrastructure and community impacts.

County: The County of San Francisco could be required to reassess local infrastructure, housing, and regulatory frameworks as the development may affect regional planning, service delivery, and affordable housing initiatives.

While this change is at the state level, local agencies involved in or affected by high-speed rail planning and infrastructure—such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities—may experience indirect impacts related to funding formulas, planning coordination, and contract adjustments.

                       City: Cities that host or are located along proposed high-speed rail corridors may need to adjust local infrastructure and transit planning strategies due to potential shifts in state budget allocations and administrative contracting.
County: Counties impacted by high-speed rail projects could face changes in the cost-sharing mechanisms and planning processes as administrative funds increase, potentially affecting local infrastructure efforts.
Special District: Special districts, particularly those involved in transit services or local infrastructure, may see modifications in administrative fund distribution that could alter their contractual obligations or local project funding.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by multiple local agencies to manage common projects may need to revisit inter-agency agreements and cost-sharing arrangements in light of the increased administrative allocation.
