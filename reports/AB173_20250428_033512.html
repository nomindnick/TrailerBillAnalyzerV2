                           This bill expands and revises the criteria that local law enforcement agencies must satisfy before requesting an Ebony Alert for missing Black youth. Agencies must now determine they have used all available local resources and that there is information which, if disseminated, could aid in safe recovery. Once the California Highway Patrol (CHP) concurs, it must activate the alert. CHP must also submit a report to the Governor and Legislature by July 1, 2027. Local agencies—city police departments, county sheriffs’ offices, special district law enforcement units, and joint powers authorities—must update policies, train personnel, document new determinations, and coordinate with CHP under the new mandatory activation requirement.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: City police departments must revise missing‐persons protocols to include mandatory new determinations (use of all available local resources; existence of recoverable information) before requesting an Ebony Alert, document those determinations, and coordinate with CHP for mandatory alert activation.
County: County sheriffs’ offices must update their missing‐persons policies to incorporate the expanded statutory criteria, document compliance with those criteria, and work with CHP to secure mandatory activation of an Ebony Alert upon concurrence.
Special District: Special district law enforcement units (e.g., transit, water, or port police) must align their missing‐persons response protocols with the new Ebony Alert criteria, document compliance, and liaise with CHP for mandatory alert issuance upon concurrence.
Joint Powers Authority: Regional law enforcement JPAs must adopt the revised Ebony Alert eligibility criteria into their interagency missing‐persons protocols, document the required determinations, and coordinate with CHP to secure mandatory alert activation.

                           This bill expands the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General’s (IG) audit and investigatory authority to cover any public or private entity receiving high-speed rail project funds, defines “personnel issues,” extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees, and requires inclusion of specified IG access provisions in all contracts and amendments executed on or after July 1, 2024. Local agencies that contract with or receive funds from the Authority—cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities—must update contract templates, extend whistleblower protections, enable IG record and property access, and prepare for potential audits or investigations. Compliance is mandatory for all qualifying contracts as of July 1, 2024.

                           This bill amends the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program administered by Caltrans, changing the funding split from a fixed 25% for planning and 75% for implementation to a flexible ‘up to 25%’ for planning with the balance for implementation. Local governments that apply for and administer these grants—cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities—will have greater flexibility in allocating grant dollars toward implementation. Affected agencies must update grant applications, internal budgets, and compliance processes to reflect the new allocation rules.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities applying for Reconnecting Communities grants now may allocate any portion up to 25% of awarded funds to planning rather than a mandatory 25%, freeing additional dollars for implementation of multimodal corridor projects. Cities must revise grant proposals, project scopes, and internal budget documents to align with the new formula.
County: Counties partnering with Caltrans on highway-to-boulevard conversions can now designate less than 25% of grant awards to planning and use a greater share for implementation. County public works and planning departments must adjust grant strategies and budget forecasts accordingly.
Special District: Transportation and public works special districts eligible for the pilot program gain discretion to allocate up to 25% to planning, with the remainder devoted to implementation. District boards and finance staff must update internal grant management policies to reflect this change.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint powers authorities formed for regional transportation projects may apply for pilot program grants with up to 25% allocated to planning. JPAs must revise interagency agreements and financial plans to capture the increased implementation funding opportunity.

                           This bill appropriates $100 million from the General Fund to Caltrans to bolster the Active Transportation Program (ATP). The funds are available for allocation by the California Transportation Commission (CTC) until June 30, 2027, and for encumbrance and liquidation until June 30, 2030. Local agencies that sponsor active transportation and Safe Routes to School projects (including cities, counties, school districts, community colleges, special districts, JPAs, and charter schools) can apply for grants through the CTC and Metropolitan Planning Agencies (MPAs). Impacted agencies must identify eligible projects, secure local matches, adopt board resolutions, comply with ATP guidelines, coordinate with regional planning bodies, and meet statutory funding and expenditure deadlines.

                           This bill tasks the Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with Caltrans and the California Transportation Commission, with identifying and reprioritizing state transportation funds (including competitive grants) that were reverted under the Budget Act of 2024 for grade separation projects.  It authorizes the Transportation Agency to directly allocate those funds to projects at risk of losing federal or local match commitments or facing schedule delays.  A report on identified funding must be delivered to the Legislature by April 30, 2025.  Local sponsors of grade separation projects—including cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities—will become eligible recipients of these reallocated funds and must engage in coordination, documentation, and board-level actions to secure and accept allocations.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that sponsor or maintain grade separation projects may receive direct allocations of reprogrammed state transportation funds.  Cities must engage with the Transportation Agency, Caltrans, and the CTC to identify eligible projects, supply evidence of federal/local match risk or schedule delays, and adopt resolutions to accept allocated funds.
County: Counties that oversee or sponsor grade separation projects on county roads become eligible for direct reallocated state funding.  Counties must coordinate with the Transportation Agency, Caltrans, and the CTC, provide project risk data, and adjust county budgets and board actions to accept awards.
Special District: Transit, rail, or other special districts sponsoring grade separation projects may qualify for direct allocations of reverted funds.  Districts must coordinate with state agencies, document match-commitment or scheduling risks, and take board actions to secure and appropriate funding.
Joint Powers Authority: Regional JPAs that manage multi-agency grade separation projects will be eligible for direct funding reallocations.  JPAs must coordinate among member agencies and with CalSTA/Caltrans/CTC, provide consolidated project risk data, and execute board-level approvals to accept funds.

                           This bill expands the existing accountability program administered by the California Transportation Agency (CalSTA) to include Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund allocations for the formula-based component of the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. It extends data‐submission requirements for regional transportation planning agencies (RTPAs) through fiscal year (FY) 2027-28 and authorizes CalSTA to modify distribution guidelines annually. RTPAs (typically Joint Powers Authorities) must submit updated regional short-term financial plans and transit operator data to remain eligible for funds. Transit operators (city, county, and special district operators) must provide updated operational and financial data to their RTPA each year.

                           This bill amends the Streets and Highways Code to add Section 2196.3, authorizing lead applicant local agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to request a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. That letter permits agencies to expend local funds on approved port freight projects or components and later seek reimbursement from program appropriations if eligibility conditions are met. The authorization sunsets June 30, 2033 and is repealed January 1, 2034. Affected local agencies—including cities, counties, special districts (e.g., port districts), and joint powers authorities—must apply for letters, track eligible expenditures, and submit reimbursement claims before the sunset date.

                           This bill authorizes the Department of General Services, with DMV consent, to enter into a lease-purchase or lease-with-option agreement for a build-to-suit office facility replacing the DMV field office in the City and County of San Francisco. Though a state project, its location triggers local land-use review, permitting, CEQA compliance, and integration of affordable housing, creating indirect impacts on San Francisco’s city and county government agencies.

                           <em class="digest-only">This bill is a budget-related trailer bill that declares it takes effect immediately as an appropriation bill tied to the Budget Act. It contains no new substantive programmatic or regulatory requirements for local agencies and does not establish or modify local programs, duties, or powers. Local agencies should note the immediate effective date in the event any appropriation line items that benefit them are adopted through the companion Budget Bill process.</em>
