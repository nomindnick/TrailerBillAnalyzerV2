                           This bill revises the funding formula for county offices of education by increasing the base grant component of the alternative education grant, modifying average daily attendance calculations, and establishing additional funding for juvenile court schools and county community schools. It also creates a new Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant providing $3,000 per unit of average daily attendance. These changes begin with the 2023-24 fiscal year and will significantly impact county office of education funding, while indirectly affecting school districts through attendance accounting.

                           This legislation makes two key changes: 1) It increases funding to the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE) from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 for statewide professional development related to antibias education and inclusive schools, and 2) It allocates $3,500,000 to county offices of education for purchasing emergency opioid antagonists for local educational agencies within their jurisdictions. Both provisions commence with the 2023-24 fiscal year.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts now have extended time to apply for and use grant funds for constructing or retrofitting facilities for transitional kindergarten and full-day kindergarten classrooms. This provides additional flexibility in planning and implementing facility projects.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may need to provide updated guidance and support to school districts regarding the extended funding availability for transitional kindergarten and kindergarten facilities.
Charter School: Charter schools that operate transitional kindergarten or kindergarten programs in district facilities may be indirectly affected by district facility improvements funded through this program.

                           This bill extends the inapplicability of certain education funding distribution calculations to include the 2023-24 fiscal year. The legislation affects how state moneys are prorated among school districts, community college districts, and state-provided instructional services, continuing the current funding methodology rather than reverting to the original calculation formula.

                           This bill establishes a new &#39;Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) Equity Multiplier&#39; apportionment, appropriating $300 million annually from the General Fund beginning in the 2023-24 fiscal year. The funds will be allocated to eligible local educational agencies based on schoolsite enrollment, with a minimum allocation of $50,000 per eligible schoolsite. This creates a significant new funding stream for qualifying educational agencies, requiring budget adjustments, compliance with allocation formulas, and potentially new reporting requirements.

                           This bill amends education funding provisions to require the Superintendent of Public Instruction to allocate to school districts, for the 2022-23 fiscal year, an amount equal to 12.5% of the difference previously calculated between 2020-21 and 2019-20 local control funding formula entitlements. This continues a declining allocation pattern (previously 25% for 2021-22) related to emergency attendance decreases. The bill also addresses Education Protection Account overpayments and continues provisions related to attendance calculations during emergencies.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts will receive an additional allocation for the 2022-23 fiscal year equal to 12.5% of the difference calculated between their 2020-21 and 2019-20 fiscal year LCFF entitlements. This continues a previous pattern of declining allocations to address pandemic-related attendance impacts.
County Office of Education: While the 12.5% allocation specifically mentions school districts, COEs should be aware of these changes as they provide fiscal oversight to districts. Additionally, the broader emergency attendance provisions in Education Code Section 46392 continue to apply to COEs.
Charter School: The 12.5% allocation specifically mentions school districts, not charter schools. However, charter schools should be aware of the continued emergency attendance provisions in Education Code Section 46392 that still apply to them.

                           This legislative change modifies how school meals are reimbursed in California. Previously, the Department of Education reimbursed local educational agencies for all nonreimbursed expenses for providing free meals to all pupils. The amendment shifts to providing state meal reimbursement specifically for reduced-price and paid meals to school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that participate in federal meal programs and comply with applicable regulations.

County Office of Education: Alters how COEs receive reimbursement for school meals provided in county-operated schools, potentially changing fiscal planning and accounting procedures.
Charter School: Explicitly includes charter schools in the state meal reimbursement program, changing how meal services are funded and potentially affecting budget planning.

                           This bill modifies funding for zero-emission schoolbuses and related infrastructure. It replaces previous multi-year funding with a one-time appropriation for fiscal year 2023-24, reducing total funding from $1.5 billion to $500 million ($375M for zero-emission schoolbuses and $125M for charging/fueling infrastructure). This affects local educational agencies that own and operate schoolbuses by limiting available funding and concentrating it in a single fiscal year.

Elimination of previously established ongoing annual funding of $225M for vehicles and $75M for infrastructure in future years. (Deadline: June 30, 2024)
County Office of Education: Reduced funding for zero-emission schoolbuses and infrastructure if the COE owns and operates schoolbuses. Elimination of ongoing funding after 2023-24 fiscal year impacts long-term planning. (Deadline: June 30, 2024)
Charter School: If charter schools own and operate schoolbuses directly (rather than contracting for services), they will face reduced available funding for zero-emission replacements and infrastructure. (Deadline: June 30, 2024)

                           This bill appropriates $1,960,500,000 from the General Fund to the State Allocation Board for the 2023-24 fiscal year for new construction and modernization projects under the Leroy F. Green School Facilities Act of 1998. It also authorizes the Department of General Services to charge up to $15,000,000 in administrative costs. This significantly increases available funding for school facility construction and modernization projects that local educational agencies can apply for.

The bill also authorizes the Department of Education to interpret these definitions and provide implementation guidance to affected local educational agencies.

                           This legislative change specifies that certain funds appropriated by the bill will count toward the minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts as established by Proposition 98 (Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution). This affects how these funds are categorized within the state&#39;s constitutional obligation to fund education rather than representing additional funding beyond the guarantee.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: Funds from this bill will count toward meeting Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantees, potentially affecting budget planning, financial forecasting, and resource allocation decisions.
Community College: The appropriated funds will count toward satisfying Proposition 98 minimum funding requirements, affecting fiscal planning and potentially resource allocation.
County Office of Education: May be indirectly affected through services provided to school districts and through potential impacts on Proposition 98 funding allocations that include COEs.
Charter School: May be affected since charter schools typically receive funding through the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) which is funded through Proposition 98.

                           This bill delays the reporting deadline for recommendations on universal preschool programs from January 15, 2023, to March 31, 2024, and requires the State Department of Education to issue guidance by December 31, 2023, on implementing a tool for strengthening teacher-child interactions in California state preschool programs. This affects local agencies that operate or oversee preschool programs, as they will need to adapt to these changes once guidance is issued.

                           This legislation reduces the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund appropriation by $1,590,595,000 (from $7,936,000,000 to $6,345,405,000) and modifies reporting requirements for local educational agencies.

                           This legislation modifies requirements for transitional kindergarten (TK) programs by: (1) delaying the 1:10 adult-to-pupil ratio requirement from 2023-24 to 2025-26 school year; (2) removing the funding contingency for this ratio; (3) extending the deadline for TK teacher qualifications from 2023 to 2025; (4) creating provisions for &#39;early enrollment&#39; of younger children in TK with specific requirements; and (5) establishing reporting requirements for districts and charter schools offering TK to early enrollment children.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: Extends deadline for implementing 1:10 adult-to-pupil ratio in TK classrooms to 2025-26, extends teacher qualification deadline to August 1, 2025, creates option to enroll &#39;early enrollment children&#39; with immediate 1:10 ratio requirement, requires concurrent preschool program offerings for 2023-24 and 2024-25 if offering early enrollment TK, and mandates reporting on early enrollment children. (Deadline: August 01, 2025)
Charter School: Charter schools offering TK programs face the same modified requirements as school districts: extended deadlines for 1:10 adult-to-pupil ratio (2025-26) and teacher qualifications (August 1, 2025), option to enroll early enrollment children with immediate ratio requirements, concurrent preschool program offerings if applicable, and mandatory reporting. (Deadline: August 01, 2025)
County Office of Education: May be indirectly affected if operating schools with TK programs or providing support services to districts implementing these changes. Will need to understand new requirements to support district compliance.

                           This legislative change amends Education Code Section 33050 to prohibit the State Board of Education from waiving laws related to kindergarten and transitional kindergarten (TK) admission requirements. Previously, school districts and county boards of education could request waivers for various education code provisions, but this amendment restricts that ability specifically for kindergarten and TK admission criteria.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts will no longer be able to request waivers from the State Board of Education for kindergarten and transitional kindergarten admission requirements. Districts must strictly adhere to statutory admission criteria such as age requirements and eligibility standards for these programs.
County Office of Education: County boards of education will no longer be able to request waivers from the State Board of Education for kindergarten and transitional kindergarten admission requirements. They must ensure all programs they operate strictly follow state law on these admissions.
Charter School: Charter schools offering kindergarten or TK programs are indirectly affected as they generally must follow the same admission requirements as traditional public schools, and their authorizers cannot obtain waivers for these requirements.

                           This legislation amends the Education Code and Welfare and Institutions Code to enhance educational services for justice-involved youth. It establishes timelines for student intake evaluations and transition planning, requires robust reporting on juvenile court school outcomes, mandates an independent evaluation of these schools, creates a workgroup on special education needs, and requires enhanced postsecondary education access through formalized partnerships between county agencies and higher education institutions.

                           This legislative change allocates $3.5 million annually from the General Fund to the State Department of Education for county offices of education to purchase and maintain emergency opioid antagonists (such as naloxone) for schools. COEs must ensure each middle school, junior high, high school, and adult school maintains a minimum of two units. Up to $350,000 can be used for COE administrative costs. This shifts from the current optional approach to a funded, systematic distribution system.

                           This legislative change amends Education Code Section 52052 to separately include &#39;long-term English learners&#39; as a distinct numerically significant pupil subgroup in the public school accountability system, in addition to the existing &#39;English learners&#39; subgroup. This creates new tracking, reporting, and accountability requirements for local educational agencies.

                           This legislation establishes a new requirement for local educational agencies (LEAs) to screen students in kindergarten through 2nd grade for risk of reading difficulties, including dyslexia. The bill requires the State Board of Education to create an expert panel by January 31, 2024, which will develop an approved list of screening instruments by December 31, 2024. LEAs must adopt one or more instruments from this list by June 30, 2025, and begin annual screening in the 2025-26 school year. LEAs must also provide appropriate supports and services to students identified as at risk for reading difficulties.

                           This legislative change amends Education Code Section 60642.7 to expand purpose limitations and prohibitions to ALL interim assessments offered by the CA Department of Education to local educational agencies (LEAs), not just specific ones. The change clarifies that all such assessments must be used only for improving teaching and learning, providing feedback, communicating with parents, and identifying professional development needs, while prohibiting their use for high-stakes purposes such as staff evaluations or student promotion/retention decisions.

                           This legislation amends Education Code Section 60900 to require local educational agencies (LEAs) to submit data to the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CalPADS) according to processes and timelines established by the Department of Education. This creates new compliance requirements for LEAs that manage K-12 education.

                           This legislative change appropriates $7,000,000 from the General Fund to the Superintendent of Public Instruction to support local educational agencies (LEAs) that voluntarily implement restorative justice best practices. The California Department of Education is already required to develop these best practices by June 1, 2024. This creates a new funding opportunity for eligible LEAs but does not mandate implementation.
                       
                    </p>

                           This legislative change amends Education Code Section 35186 to modify the uniform complaint process for teacher misassignment cases. The threshold for filing complaints about teachers lacking proper credentials to teach English learners has been significantly lowered from classes with &#39;more than 20%&#39; English learner pupils to classes with &#39;one or more&#39; English learner pupils. This expands the scope of when complaints can be filed and creates new compliance requirements for educational agencies.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must update their uniform complaint procedures to address teacher misassignment complaints when a teacher lacks credentials/training to teach English learners in any class with one or more English learner pupils (previously only applied to classes with &gt;20% English learners). This creates additional compliance requirements and may require staffing adjustments.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may need to provide support and guidance to school districts implementing these changes, particularly in relation to credential compliance and uniform complaint procedures.
Charter School: Charter schools are likely subject to similar requirements regarding uniform complaint procedures and teacher credentialing for English learners, and will need to adjust their practices to meet the new lower threshold.

                           This legislative change amends Education Code provisions related to teacher credentialing and monitoring of educator assignments. It expands requirements for the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and the Department of Education regarding the State Assignment Accountability System, enhances monitoring of educator misassignments, and broadens reporting requirements. The bill explicitly creates new duties for county superintendents and local educational agencies regarding educator assignment monitoring and reporting.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts will face enhanced monitoring of educator assignments, must ensure access to accountability system results, and could face new regulations/sanctions for consistently misassigning educators. Districts with schools where 15%+ of teachers hold lesser certifications will face additional scrutiny.
Charter School: Charter schools are specifically identified as LEAs subject to the enhanced monitoring and potential sanctions for educator misassignments. They must comply with the same requirements as other LEAs regarding educator assignments and credentials.
County Office of Education: County superintendents will have expanded duties related to inspecting schools on the Superintendent&#39;s list and submitting annual reports on the state of schools in the county. The bill explicitly creates new duties for county superintendents of schools.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: Districts will need to recognize and accept these new comparable credentials for military members and their families during hiring processes. HR departments must understand the duration limitations of these credentials and verify their validity. Districts will also need to recognize that certain candidates are exempt from teaching performance assessments.
Charter School: Charter schools must recognize comparable credentials issued to military members and their families, and understand exemptions from teaching performance assessments for certain credential candidates.
County Office of Education: COEs often provide credentialing guidance to districts and may need to provide updated information regarding these new credential pathways and exemptions. COEs that directly employ teachers will also need to update their hiring practices.

                           This bill amends the Teacher Residency Grant Program by: (1) allowing residency candidates to fulfill their 4-year service commitment in any California public school rather than only in schools within the jurisdiction of the grant recipient; (2) increasing the maximum grant amount from $25,000 to $40,000 per candidate; (3) requiring grant recipients to provide a minimum compensation package of $20,000 to candidates; and (4) extending the program evaluation deadline from December 1, 2027, to December 1, 2029.

                       School District: School districts that participate in the Teacher Residency Grant Program will receive increased grant funding (up to $40,000 per candidate, up from $25,000) but must provide a minimum compensation package of $20,000 to candidates. Districts will also need to adjust to the change that allows candidates to fulfill their service commitment in any California public school rather than only within their district. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: Charter schools participating in the Teacher Residency Grant Program will be subject to the same changes as school districts regarding increased grant amounts and minimum compensation requirements. Additionally, charter schools may now be able to hire teachers who completed residencies elsewhere in California to fulfill their service commitment. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education that sponsor teacher residency programs will need to adapt to the increased grant amounts, new minimum compensation requirements, and expanded service options for candidates. They may also need to provide guidance to districts on these changes. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)

                           This legislation amends the Bilingual Teacher Professional Development Program to expand its purpose to include increasing bilingual teachers in multiple languages (Spanish, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, Arabic, and others). It appropriates $20 million from the General Fund to provide $4 million in grants annually from 2023-24 to 2027-28, requires quarterly meetings between the Department of Education and grant recipients, and establishes new reporting requirements for grant recipients.

                           This legislation expands the Golden State Teacher Grant Program to include students committed to working in California preschool programs, extends the credential completion timeframe from 3 to 6 years, allows service at schools that were on the priority list when employment began to satisfy the requirement even if they later fall off the list, and authorizes certain online nonprofit institutions to participate with reduced grant amounts ($10,000 vs $20,000).

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: Districts will benefit from an expanded pool of qualified teachers incentivized to work at priority schools. The extension allowing teachers to continue satisfying their service requirement even if a school falls off the priority list will support teacher retention. Districts operating preschool programs will now be able to recruit teachers supported by this grant program.
County Office of Education: COEs that operate preschool programs will now be eligible placement sites for grant recipients. Additionally, COEs that provide support services to districts with priority schools will need to be aware of these changes when advising on teacher recruitment and retention strategies.
Charter School: Charter schools on the priority school list will benefit from access to grant recipients for staffing. The change allowing continued service at schools that fall off the priority list will support teacher retention.

                           This legislation amends the California School Finance Authority Act to change how educational agencies secure financing. It shifts from a state-controlled process requiring notification to the Controller to a &#39;local intercept&#39; option where participating parties request county treasurer involvement. Counties must agree to participate and would then handle apportionments or revenue transfers. The law also limits school districts and county offices of education with qualified or negative financial certifications to intercept payments only for indebtedness where repayment is determined to be probable.
                       
                    </p>

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts can now elect to participate in a local intercept by sending requests to county treasurers rather than the State Controller when securing financing or refinancing projects. Districts with qualified or negative financial certifications face additional limitations - they can only intercept payments for indebtedness where repayment is determined to be probable.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education can now use the local intercept method for financing. Those with qualified or negative financial certifications are limited to intercepting payments only for indebtedness where repayment is determined to be probable.
County: County treasurers and fiscal officers gain new responsibilities to receive, evaluate, and potentially approve requests from educational agencies for local intercept financing. If they agree to participate, they must make apportionments or revenue transfers as specified.
Charter School: If charter schools qualify as &#39;participating parties&#39; under the California School Finance Authority Act, they would have access to this local intercept method for financing or refinancing projects.

                           This legislative change modifies the State Controller&#39;s audit guide requirements by removing instructions for determining unspent funds associated with Charter School Facilities Program projects, Career Technical Education Facilities Program projects, and projects where local educational agencies received hardship funding. The bill also repeals Education Code Sections 52072 and 52072.5.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts that have received funding through the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act will experience modified audit procedures. The removal of specific audit requirements for determining unspent funds may simplify reporting for completed projects but will require adaptation to new audit guidelines once updated by the Controller.
Charter School: Charter schools with facilities funded through the Charter School Facilities Program will no longer be subject to specific audit procedures for determining unspent funds on completed projects. This may streamline their reporting requirements but requires adjustments to current practices.
County Office of Education: As local educational agencies, County Offices of Education that receive facilities funding will experience changes in audit requirements, potentially reducing administrative burden related to determining unspent funds on completed projects.
Community College: Community colleges involved in Career Technical Education Facilities Program projects will experience modified audit procedures with the removal of specific requirements for determining unspent funds.

They will not receive the standard transportation allowance equal to 60% of home-to-school transportation expenditures and will not be required to develop transportation plans that prioritize service for TK-6 and low-income students.
Charter School: Districtwide charter schools will be exempt from state transportation funding provisions that provide a 60% transportation allowance and require development of transportation plans. This affects only full districtwide charter conversions, not individual charter schools.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may need to provide guidance to school districts regarding this change, especially for districts considering districtwide charter conversion or those already operating as districtwide charters.

                           This legislation amends the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program by specifying licensing requirements based on whether programs are operated directly by LEAs or through third parties, establishing new reporting requirements for programs operated off-campus by third-party providers, and modifying fund expenditure timelines. LEAs now have extended periods to expend or encumber program funds through the 2023-24 fiscal year.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must comply with new licensing requirements for Expanded Learning Opportunities Programs. Districts contracting with third-party providers for off-campus programs must submit annual program access information through a new process. Districts also receive extended flexibility to expend or encumber program funds through the 2023-24 fiscal year.
Charter School: Charter schools operating Expanded Learning Opportunities Programs must comply with new licensing requirements. Those contracting with third-party providers for off-campus programs must submit annual program access information. Charter schools now have extended flexibility to expend or encumber program funds through the 2023-24 fiscal year.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education must understand and potentially help implement new licensing requirements and reporting processes for Expanded Learning Opportunities Programs in their jurisdiction. They may need to provide guidance to districts and charter schools about compliance with these new requirements.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts that authorize charter schools must implement automatic one-year term extensions for charter schools with terms expiring between Jan 1, 2024-Jun 30, 2027. Districts must continue to observe the prohibition on approving nonclassroom-based charters for an additional year. Districts will benefit from a higher standard for State Board of Education to overturn charter denial decisions, as the State Board must now find abuse of discretion by both the district and county board.
Charter School: Charter schools with terms expiring between Jan 1, 2024-Jun 30, 2027 will receive automatic one-year extensions. Charter schools seeking to appeal denials to the State Board of Education face a higher threshold for reversal. The prohibition on new nonclassroom-based charter schools continues until Jan 1, 2026. &#39;Acquiring charter schools&#39; will maintain their status as &#39;continuing charter schools&#39; until July 1, 2026.

                           This legislative change reduces the appropriation from the General Fund to the State Superintendent for charter schools from $413,000,000 to $290,023,000 for the 2022-23 fiscal year, representing a significant funding cut of $122,977,000 (approximately 30%). This directly impacts charter schools&#39; budgets and operations, with potential indirect effects on their authorizing entities.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       Charter School: Charter schools will receive significantly less funding than originally appropriated for the 2022-23 fiscal year, requiring budget adjustments, possible program reductions, staffing changes, or identification of alternative funding sources. (Deadline: June 30, 2023)
School District: School districts that serve as charter authorizers may need to provide additional oversight of charter schools&#39; financial stability following this funding reduction. Districts may also face increased requests for support or accommodation from financially stressed charter schools.
County Office of Education: County offices that authorize charter schools may need to provide additional financial oversight and potentially technical assistance to charter schools affected by the funding reduction.

                           This legislation extends the prohibition on school districts creating single-district Special Education Local Plan Areas (SELPAs) until July 1, 2026 (previously July 1, 2024). It also requires SELPAs to use a specific formula for allocating 2023-24 special education funding to member Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) based on prior year funding, inflation, and ADA changes. Additionally, the Superintendent must post all SELPA local plans on the Department of Education&#39;s website.
                       
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts cannot create single-district SELPAs for an additional two years (until July 1, 2026). As member LEAs of SELPAs, they will receive special education funding based on the specified allocation formula for 2023-24 that accounts for prior year funding, inflation, and changes in average daily attendance. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education that serve as administrative units for SELPAs must implement the new funding allocation requirements. Those that are member LEAs of SELPAs will receive funding based on the specified formula. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: Charter schools that are member LEAs of SELPAs will receive special education funding based on the specified allocation formula for 2023-24. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)

                           This bill establishes a mechanism to stabilize special education funding by June 30, 2024, by authorizing the Director of Finance to appropriate additional General Fund money if revenues from successor agencies to local educational agencies (LEAs) for special education fall below expected levels. Conversely, if these revenues exceed expectations, the appropriation will be reduced accordingly. This creates a financial safety net for special education programs but introduces uncertainty for LEAs until the final determination is made.

                           This legislative change amends Education Code Section 52065, expanding requirements for posting Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAPs) online. School district superintendents must now post LCAPs approved by BOTH the governing board AND the county superintendent of schools. County superintendents must post LCAPs approved by BOTH the county board of education AND the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. This creates new mandatory website posting requirements for both school districts and county offices of education.

School District: School districts in counties with only one district will now have their LCAP implementation formally reviewed and supported by the county superintendent through the newly required summary process.

                           This legislative change amends Education Code Section 52070 to require school districts and county offices of education meeting specified criteria to include additional information in their Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAPs) or annual updates. These agencies must document actions and services that implement technical assistance for improving outcomes of specific pupil groups. This creates new reporting requirements for affected educational agencies.

County Office of Education: County offices of education meeting specified criteria must include in their LCAP or annual update the actions and services that implement work related to technical assistance for improving outcomes of specific pupil groups.
Charter School: While not explicitly mentioned in the bill text, charter schools may be indirectly affected if these LCAP requirements are applied to all educational agencies that must submit LCAPs. Charter schools in California generally must develop LCAPs similar to traditional public schools.

                           This legislative change amends Education Code Section 52071, expanding requirements for county superintendents of schools to provide technical assistance to certain school districts. It mandates technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years for districts with underperforming pupil subgroups, requires assistance for districts that fail to submit required data, and introduces collaborative assistance from geographic lead agencies for persistently underperforming districts.

                       County Office of Education: County superintendents must now provide technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years (instead of just providing assistance with no specified duration) to school districts with pupil subgroups meeting certain performance criteria. They must also provide technical assistance to districts that fail to submit required data to the department, and collaborate with geographic lead agencies for districts meeting performance criteria for 3+ consecutive years.
School District: School districts with underperforming pupil subgroups will receive technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years. Districts that fail to submit required data will receive technical assistance. Districts meeting performance criteria for 3+ consecutive years will receive collaborative assistance from their geographic lead agency and county superintendent.
Joint Powers Authority: Geographic lead agencies (which may be structured as JPAs) must now collaborate with county superintendents to provide technical assistance to school districts that meet performance criteria for 3+ consecutive years.

                           This legislative change modifies Education Code Section 52071.5 regarding technical assistance provided by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to county offices of education (COEs). The key changes include: (1) requiring technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years (instead of an unspecified period) for COEs where specific pupil subgroups meet certain performance criteria, and (2) mandating technical assistance for COEs that fail to submit specified data to the department.
                       
                    </p>

                       County Office of Education: COEs will now receive technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years if certain pupil subgroups meet specific performance criteria. Additionally, COEs that fail to submit required data will trigger technical assistance from the State Superintendent. This changes both the duration and triggering conditions for state intervention.
School District: Since County Offices of Education provide services and support to school districts, changes to how COEs receive technical assistance may indirectly affect the support services available to districts. Districts with underperforming subgroups may see more sustained intervention from their COEs.

                           This bill modifies which entities can request advice and assistance from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence (CCEE). It restricts school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to only those &#39;eligible for certain technical assistance&#39; rather than allowing any of these agencies to request services. Additionally, it authorizes the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT) to request CCEE services, with a requirement to reimburse CCEE for costs.

                           This legislation revises and recasts the process for identifying school districts and county offices of education in need of intervention. It creates two separate intervention processes: 1) requiring the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence (CCEE) to determine if assistance is necessary, and 2) authorizing the Superintendent of Public Instruction to identify agencies needing intervention if they fail to implement CCEE recommendations or show persistent/acute inadequate performance. The bill imposes new duties on school districts and county offices of education to collaborate with the CCEE.
                       
                    </p>

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts that meet criteria for underperformance with three or more pupil subgroups (or all subgroups if fewer than three exist) for three out of four consecutive years will be subject to a new two-step intervention process. First, the CCEE must consult with the district to determine if assistance is necessary. Second, the Superintendent may intervene if the district fails to implement CCEE recommendations or shows persistent inadequate performance.
County Office of Education: County offices of education that meet criteria for underperformance with three or more pupil subgroups (or all subgroups if fewer than three exist) for three out of four consecutive years will be subject to a new two-step intervention process, similar to school districts. The CCEE must first consult with the COE, and then the Superintendent may intervene if necessary.
Charter School: While charter schools are not directly subject to the intervention process described in the legislation, they may be indirectly affected if their authorizing school district or county office of education comes under intervention. Additionally, the legislation affirms CCEE&#39;s role in advising and assisting charter schools.

                           This legislative change amends the Community Engagement Initiative Expansion to require that partnerships between community engagement professional learning networks and other communities/school districts include providing fiscal support to partner organizations. This requirement enhances partner organizations&#39; capacity for meaningful collaboration and implementation of the Community Engagement Initiative. The change impacts how school districts, county offices of education, and potentially charter schools structure and fund their community engagement partnerships.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts participating in community engagement professional learning networks must now provide fiscal support to partner organizations in addition to collaborative efforts. This creates a new funding obligation and changes how partnerships are structured and maintained.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education that participate in or coordinate community engagement professional learning networks will need to ensure fiscal support is provided to partner organizations. This applies particularly to COEs that may serve as lead agencies in the collaborative.
Charter School: Charter schools that participate in community engagement professional learning networks may need to provide fiscal support to partner organizations. This impact depends on the charter school&#39;s involvement in the Community Engagement Initiative.

                           This bill requires the Legislative Analyst&#39;s Office to provide recommendations by March 15, 2024, for changes to the local control and accountability plan (LCAP) for county offices of education or alternative reporting requirements. While the bill itself only mandates the LAO to conduct analysis, the resulting recommendations could significantly impact how COEs report and account for their operations in the future, with potential downstream effects on school districts and charter schools that interact with COEs.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       County Office of Education: The LAO will be making recommendations specifically about COE LCAPs or alternative reporting requirements, which could substantially change how COEs report on their goals, actions, and expenditures. While no immediate action is required, COEs should prepare for potential changes to their LCAP structure or the implementation of new reporting systems following the LAO recommendations.
School District: Changes to COE reporting requirements may indirectly affect school districts, particularly regarding how COEs provide oversight, support, and technical assistance to districts. Since COEs play a key role in reviewing district LCAPs and providing support for implementation, changes to COE reporting structures could affect these interactions.
Charter School: Charter schools authorized by COEs could be indirectly affected if changes to COE reporting requirements alter how charter school oversight is documented or reported. Additionally, any changes to COE oversight practices resulting from modified reporting requirements could affect charter school operations.

                           This legislation changes how the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) manages fees collected for teacher credentialing tests and examinations. Starting July 1, 2023, fees previously deposited in the Test Development and Administration Account will go directly into the Teacher Credentials Fund and be exempt from fee reduction requirements when surplus funds exist. The Department of Finance will annually recommend credential fees sufficient to support the CTC&#39;s operating budget plus a prudent reserve.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: While this change primarily affects state-level financial management, school districts may experience indirect impacts if the reorganization of these funds leads to changes in credential testing fees that affect teacher candidates or current teachers maintaining credentials. Districts that reimburse credential fees or testing costs for employees may need to monitor for potential fee changes resulting from this financial restructuring.
Charter School: Similar to school districts, charter schools may experience indirect impacts if this financial restructuring eventually affects credential testing fees for teacher candidates or current teachers. Charter schools that cover credential costs for employees should monitor for potential fee changes.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may experience indirect impacts from this restructuring if credential testing fees change as a result. Additionally, COEs that provide credentialing support or information to districts may need to update guidance if fee structures change.
Community College: Community colleges with teacher preparation programs or that advise students pursuing teaching careers may need to update information about credential testing costs if fee structures change as a result of this financial restructuring.
