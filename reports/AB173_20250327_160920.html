                       This bill expands the criteria that law enforcement agencies must satisfy to request the activation of an Ebony Alert for missing Black youth. Specifically, the bill requires that before an alert is requested, the investigating agency must determine that all available local resources have been exhausted and that there exists actionable information that, if shared with the public, could help in safely recovering the missing individual. Local law enforcement agencies (such as city police departments and county sheriff’s offices) are affected because they are responsible for making these determinations and updating their investigative protocols to comply with the revised requirements.

                       This bill expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program to include funds appropriated from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. It primarily affects regional transportation planning agencies—local public agencies that coordinate transit planning and operator data reporting—because they now must update and resubmit their regional short-term financial plans and transit operator data to secure funding. As a result, these agencies face additional compliance requirements with new, tighter reporting deadlines across multiple upcoming fiscal years.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill adds a new mandate that requires the Department of Transportation to compile and submit an annual report—starting in 2025—detailing its zero-emission vehicle acquisitions, duty performance metrics, and charging/refueling infrastructure. Although the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation affects local, state, and federal government fleets, the new reporting obligation applies solely to the state-level DOT. Local public agencies such as cities, counties, school districts, special districts, and JPAs are not directly required to produce or submit similar reports, though they may use the DOT’s published data to guide their own fleet management and infrastructure planning.

                       This bill expands the role of the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General by adding the duty to review and investigate whether public or private entities receiving high-speed rail project funds adhere to specific contract provisions. It affects local public agencies—such as cities, counties, and special districts—that enter into contracts with the Authority for project-related work, because these agencies must now include provisions granting the Inspector General access to records and property and extend whistleblower protections to their contractor employees. As a result, these agencies will need to update their contract templates, compliance procedures, and internal oversight processes, with significant changes taking effect for contracts or amendments executed on or after July 1, 2024 and annual budget notifications due by January 10.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises the funding allocation for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program. Instead of mandating a fixed allocation of 25% of available funds for planning (with 75% for implementation), the bill now requires that up to 25% of available funds be set aside for planning, with the remainder directed to implementation. Local public agencies—such as local agencies, joint powers authorities, and transit agencies—are affected because they are among the eligible applicants for both planning and implementation grants under the program. They will need to reassess their project proposals, budgeting, and inter-agency coordination as the flexible allocation may alter the amount available for planning projects compared to the previous fixed standard.
                    </p>

                       This bill amends the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program by authorizing lead applicant agencies to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This change affects local public agencies such as port authorities, local transportation agencies, and special districts that administer or operate eligible port projects because they now have the option to fund projects using their own money with an opportunity for later state reimbursement. As a result, these agencies gain increased financial flexibility to initiate port-specific projects, but they must meet specific conditions—including project commencement, eligible expenditures, and compliance with legal standards like CEQA—before reimbursement is approved.

                       This bill appropriates $100,000,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation, enhancing its Active Transportation Program designed to promote biking, walking, and other active transportation initiatives. It affects local public agencies such as metropolitan planning agencies and municipal governments because these entities are involved in identifying and developing eligible transportation projects that can receive state-allocated funds. As a result, these agencies will have increased funding opportunities for active transportation projects but must adhere to new compliance requirements and deadlines for fund allocation and liquidation.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill introduces a change in the way state funding is allocated by requiring the Secretary of Transportation to coordinate with both the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify available funds in state transportation programs. The funds are to be used to support grade separation projects that had previously received funding but later had that funding reverted under the Budget Act of 2024. While these grade separation projects may involve local funding commitments and affect project schedules, no local public agencies (such as cities, counties, school districts, special districts, or JPAs) are directly required to take any new compliance actions under this bill.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill authorizes the Department of General Services, with the consent of the Department of Motor Vehicles, to enter into a lease‐purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility that will replace the DMV field office in the City and County of San Francisco. Although the primary contracting parties are state agencies, the project&#39;s location in San Francisco brings local public agencies (specifically the City and County government) into play because the mixed-use development—potentially integrating affordable housing—may require coordination with local planning, zoning, and infrastructure oversight. Local agencies may be indirectly impacted through review of zoning ordinances, integration of community benefits, and ensuring that the project complies with local planning requirements.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends the high-speed rail bond act by increasing the maximum percentage of bond proceeds that can be allocated for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5%. It affects only the financial administration of the state-level high-speed rail project and does not impact local public agencies such as cities, counties, school districts, special districts, or JPAs. Therefore, local agencies are not directly impacted by this legislative change and do not need to adjust their operations or compliance measures.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill declares that it is to take effect immediately and is solely an appropriations measure related to the Budget Bill. It does not target local public agencies such as cities, counties, school districts, special districts, or JPAs because it is not a local program. Consequently, there are no new compliance requirements or operational changes imposed on these agencies as a result of this legislative change.
