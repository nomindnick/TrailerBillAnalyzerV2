                       The bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to work with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and reallocate state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost local or federal funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. Although the provision is state driven, it impacts Cities, Special Districts, and Counties — local entities that often commit local funding or partner in these projects — by potentially supplementing or replacing lost funds. Local agencies will need to engage with state agencies to provide project documentation, adjust funding plans, and coordinate on timelines to align with state priorities.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities may see state funds applied to grade separation projects where local funding commitments have reverted. They must coordinate with state agencies to align their project requirements with the identified funding priorities.
Special District: Special Districts involved in regional infrastructure projects may benefit from direct state allocations to cover shortfalls. They will need to adjust their project funding procedures and ensure that project timelines and reporting are in sync with state requirements.
County: Counties, which often play a key role in supporting or co-funding transportation projects, may have funding gaps addressed by state reallocation. They should update their project plans and collaborate closely with state agencies to guarantee that the project reviews and schedules meet the new funding criteria.

                       This bill expands the existing statewide accountability program by including funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund into the formula-based component of the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. In addition to the existing requirements applicable for the 2023–24 and 2024–25 fiscal years, regional transportation planning agencies must now submit an updated regional short‐term financial plan and updated transit operator data for FY 2025–26, and updated transit operator data for FY 2026–27 and FY 2027–28. Local agencies such as Cities, Counties, and Special Districts that participate in regional transportation planning or operate transit services may be affected by these new reporting and documentation obligations.

                       City: Cities that are part of regional transportation planning or operate transit services will need to ensure that their financial plans and transit operator data are updated and submitted as required to access state funding under the expanded program.
County: Counties involved in regional planning or transit operations must align with the new accountability measures by coordinating the preparation and submission of updated financial plans and transit operator data to qualify for the additional funds allocated from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
Special District: Special districts, particularly those managing transit or regional planning services, are required to meet the enhanced reporting guidelines by updating their short-term financial plans and transit data in accordance with the new deadlines. They must also remain alert to any modifications to submission guidelines as authorized by the Transportation Agency.

                                    For FY 2025–26, regional transportation planning agencies must submit an updated short-term financial plan along with updated transit operator data. For FY 2026–27 and FY 2027–28, submission of updated transit operator data is required. Specific submission dates will be set by the Transportation Agency as they modify the distribution guidelines.

                       The bill mandates that the Department of Transportation compile and submit annual reports—beginning in 2025—detailing its zero-emission vehicle acquisitions, performance data, and supporting infrastructure. While the reporting obligation directly applies to the DOT, Special District agencies, as local entities, may be impacted indirectly by state-level shifts towards zero-emission fleet standards. They are likely to use these reports as benchmarks for modernizing their own fleet policies and transitioning to sustainable vehicle options.

                       Special District: Though not directly required to file reports, Special District agencies will be affected by the increased emphasis on zero-emission fleet operations. They may need to adapt procurement policies to align with evolving state standards and use the DOT&#39;s performance data as a benchmark for transitioning their fleets.

                       The bill broadens the oversight powers of the High-Speed Rail Authority’s Inspector General. It now requires that any contract or contract amendment involving high-speed rail project funds, executed on or after July 1, 2024, include specific provisions granting the Inspector General access to records and property. Additionally, the bill extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees. For cities involved as public entities in such contracts, this means updates to contractual language and tighter compliance measures to meet enhanced audit and review requirements.

                       The bill revises the funding mechanism for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by replacing the fixed allocation—25% for planning and 75% for implementation—with a flexible cap that allows up to 25% of available funds to be set aside for planning while designating the remainder for implementation. This change gives eligible local agencies more discretion to align funding with their project needs.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       Special District: As eligible entities under the program, Special Districts can now allocate less than 25% of funding to planning if their project conditions merit it, thereby freeing additional funds for implementation. They must re-examine project proposals and internal budgeting in light of the new flexibility.
City: Cities applying for the pilot program can take advantage of the flexible planning cap to better tailor their funding use—potentially reserving more funds for implementing roadway conversion projects. They need to revise their strategy and submission guidelines to fit the new allocation rules.
County: Counties participating in the program now have the opportunity to shift funds toward more extensive implementation if less is required up front for planning. To benefit, they must recalibrate their project budgeting strategies and engage with state guidelines on fund distribution.

                       This bill amends existing law by allowing a lead applicant agency under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply to the Secretary of Transportation for a letter of no prejudice. This letter permits the agency to use its own funds on a project or project component, with the possibility of later reimbursement from program funds if specific conditions are met. The provision is temporary, becoming inoperative on 2033-06-30 and repealed on 2034-01-01.

                       City: City agencies designated as lead applicants can now apply for a letter of no prejudice. This enables them to front project expenses using local funds and later seek reimbursement, provided they satisfy the eligibility and documentation conditions set forth by the Secretary of Transportation. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
County: County agencies acting as lead applicants under the program are similarly empowered to apply for a letter of no prejudice. This permits them to fund portions of port and freight infrastructure projects using their own resources, with future reimbursement available if all statutory conditions are met.
