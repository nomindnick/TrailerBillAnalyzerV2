                           This legislation amends Government Code Section 8594.14 to modify the Ebony Alert system for missing Black youth. It expands and revises the criteria law enforcement agencies must meet before requesting an alert, makes CHP activation mandatory when criteria are met, and requires a report to the Governor and Legislature by July 1, 2027. This impacts local law enforcement agencies operated by cities and counties.

                           This legislation requires the Secretary of Transportation to coordinate with Caltrans and the California Transportation Commission to identify funding for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. The Transportation Agency is authorized to prioritize and allocate funding to projects at risk of losing federal/local funding commitments or facing schedule delays. This affects local agencies that sponsor, manage, or co-fund grade separation projects.

                           This bill expands California&#39;s transit funding accountability program to include Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund allocations for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. It extends reporting requirements through FY 2027-28, mandating regional transportation planning agencies (RTPAs) to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data to receive funding. These changes affect local agencies that operate transit systems or participate in regional transportation planning.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       County: Counties that serve as or participate in regional transportation planning agencies must comply with new reporting requirements to receive transit funding. This affects counties that operate transit systems or are involved in regional transportation planning. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
City: Cities that operate transit systems or participate in regional transportation planning will be indirectly affected by new accountability requirements. Access to transit funding will depend on their regional transportation planning agency&#39;s compliance with reporting requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
Special District: Transit districts and other special districts involved in transportation will need to comply with expanded accountability program requirements. This affects their access to transit funding, particularly from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs that function as regional transportation planning agencies must comply with new reporting requirements to access funding. This affects multi-agency transportation authorities and planning bodies. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)

                           This legislation authorizes the Department of General Services, with DMV consent, to enter into a lease-purchase agreement for a build-to-suit facility to replace the DMV field office in San Francisco. The project may include affordable housing as part of a mixed-use development. While primarily affecting state agencies, there are indirect impacts on local agencies in San Francisco related to development coordination and affordable housing.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: The City of San Francisco will need to coordinate with state agencies on the development, particularly if affordable housing is included. This involves planning processes, permitting, and infrastructure coordination for the new DMV facility and potential housing component.
County: As San Francisco is both a city and county, the County of San Francisco will be involved in coordinating services and approvals for the development, particularly related to the potential affordable housing component.
Special District: Special districts providing utilities or other services in the development area may need to coordinate with the project to ensure adequate service provision.

                           This legislative change modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program funding allocation formula. Previously, the program required a fixed allocation of 25% for planning and 75% for implementation. The amendment changes this to &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning and the remainder for implementation, creating more flexibility in how funds are distributed between planning and implementation activities.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that partner with Caltrans on highway conversion projects may see changes in available funding for planning versus implementation phases. With the more flexible allocation, cities may need to adjust their grant application strategies, as more funding could potentially be directed toward implementation if planning requires less than 25% of available funds.
County: Counties involved in highway conversion projects within their boundaries may experience shifts in available funding between planning and implementation phases. The more flexible allocation could affect ongoing or planned projects that cross through county territories.
Special District: Transportation-focused special districts that may apply for these grants could see changes in funding availability for planning versus implementation activities. Districts involved in regional transportation planning will need to adapt to the more flexible funding allocation.
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs formed to address regional transportation needs may be affected by the change in funding allocation flexibility, particularly those involved in multi-agency highway conversion projects.

                           This bill modifies the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to authorize lead applicant agencies to apply for a &#39;letter of no prejudice&#39; that allows them to spend their own funds on approved port infrastructure projects with the possibility of future reimbursement from program funds. This creates a new financing option for local agencies involved in port and freight infrastructure projects, while establishing a sunset date of June 30, 2033 for these provisions.

                       Special District: Port authorities, harbor districts, and other special districts that operate or administer port facilities now have the option to request a letter of no prejudice to advance fund their port infrastructure projects and receive later reimbursement from state program funds. This provides greater flexibility to move forward with critical projects without waiting for state funding disbursement. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
City: Cities with ports or that serve as lead applicant agencies for port-related roadway infrastructure projects can utilize the letter of no prejudice mechanism to advance projects using local funds with the potential for future state reimbursement. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
County: Counties that administer transportation infrastructure projects serving ports can utilize the letter of no prejudice mechanism to advance projects using county funds with potential for future state reimbursement. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs formed to administer port or freight infrastructure projects can now utilize the letter of no prejudice mechanism to advance fund approved projects and seek later reimbursement from state program funds. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities are primary applicants for ATP grants to implement bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure projects. This $100 million appropriation creates new funding opportunities for cities to develop or expand active transportation networks. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
County: Counties can apply for ATP grants to implement active transportation projects in unincorporated areas and to develop regional connections. This additional funding creates new opportunities for counties to secure transportation infrastructure grants. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Special District: Transportation-related special districts (transit districts, recreation districts, etc.) may be eligible for ATP funding for projects that encourage biking and walking within their service areas. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs formed to address regional transportation issues can apply for ATP grants, especially for projects spanning multiple jurisdictions. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
School District: School districts may partner with local governments on Safe Routes to School projects, which are commonly funded through ATP. This additional funding could benefit school districts indirectly. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)

                           This legislation declares it will take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill, as allowed under Article IV, Section 12(e) of the California Constitution. While the text doesn&#39;t specify which appropriations are included, the immediate effectiveness could impact local agencies that receive state funding through the budget process. The timing of fund disbursement would be accelerated compared to standard January 1 implementation.

                       School District: School districts that receive state funding through budget appropriations may need to prepare for earlier receipt or implementation of funds than with standard January 1 effective legislation. This could affect fiscal planning, budgeting timelines, and program implementation schedules.
Charter School: Charter schools receiving state funding may experience changes in the timing of fund disbursements due to the immediate effectiveness of budget appropriations.
County Office of Education: COEs may need to adjust their fiscal planning based on the immediate effectiveness of budget-related appropriations that affect their operations or the services they provide to districts.
Community College: Community colleges may need to adjust fiscal planning based on accelerated implementation of budget appropriations that affect their funding.
City: Cities that receive state funding for various programs may experience changes in the timing of fund disbursements.
County: Counties administer many state-funded programs and may need to adjust implementation timelines based on the immediate effectiveness of budget appropriations.
Special District: Special districts that receive state funding may need to adjust financial planning based on accelerated implementation of budget provisions.

                           This bill requires the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to compile and submit annual reports to the Legislature regarding zero-emission vehicles in its fleet and related infrastructure. The reporting requirement begins October 1, 2025, and sunsets on January 1, 2036. While the bill does not create new requirements for local agencies, the resulting data may provide valuable insights for local agencies managing their own fleet transitions under the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation.
