                       The bill revises California&#39;s public school financing system by increasing the alternative education grant&#39;s base component, modifying how average daily attendance is calculated, and establishing new funding add-ons and a Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant. These changes affect local agencies involved in K-12 education funding, both directly and indirectly, with implementation beginning in the 2023–24 fiscal year.

                       School District: Changes to the alternative education grant—specifically the increased base grant and revised average daily attendance calculations—affect state funding allocations to school districts. School districts will need to update their reporting systems and budgeting models to comply with the new formulas. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: As state funding for charter schools is determined using the adjusted local control funding formula, charter schools will be indirectly affected by the revised calculations for average daily attendance. They must review their compliance and funding reporting processes. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
County Office of Education: County offices of education will receive additional funding through $200,000 add-ons for operating juvenile court schools and county community schools, as well as a Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant of $3,000 per unit of average daily attendance. Agencies must verify program eligibility and integrate these allocations into local control plans. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)

                       The proposed legislative change increases the add‐on funding to the county superintendent’s local control funding formula allocation by an additional $100,000 starting in the 2023–24 fiscal year. This change will directly impact the County Office of Education, which administers these funds, and indirectly impact School Districts that may see adjustments in their funding levels. Affected agencies will need to update budgeting, accounting, and reporting practices to comply with the new funding requirements.

                       The legislative change increases the add‐on funding for the Los Angeles County Office of Education’s local control funding—from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 beginning in the 2023–24 fiscal year—to support statewide professional development and leadership training in antibias education. In addition, a new appropriation of $3,500,000 per fiscal year is established for county offices of education statewide to purchase and maintain a sufficient stock of emergency opioid antagonists for local educational agencies. This results in both direct funding and operational changes for county offices of education and indirect compliance and emergency preparedness requirements for school districts and charter schools.

In addition, all county offices of education must now administer a new program that appropriates $3,500,000 per fiscal year to purchase and maintain emergency opioid antagonists for local educational agencies. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
School District: As local educational agencies, school districts may be indirectly impacted when county offices of education distribute emergency opioid antagonists. Districts will need to coordinate with county protocols to ensure proper storage, use, and compliance with new emergency response requirements. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: Charter schools, as independent local educational agencies, could also be affected if they receive emergency opioid antagonist allocations through their county office of education. They will need to adopt proper safety and storage protocols in line with the new program initiatives. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)

                       The legislative change expands the scope of the California Prekindergarten Planning and Implementation Grant Program by authorizing the reallocation of unexpended or collected grant funds for professional development, credentialing, and related expenses of early childhood educators. This change creates new funding channels and compliance requirements that impact local educational agencies, particularly school districts, charter schools, and county offices of education.

                       School District: School districts will now be eligible to receive additional funds aimed at covering professional development, credential attainment, and training costs for prekindergarten, transitional kindergarten, and kindergarten staff. They must implement new tracking and compliance measures to ensure funds are used exclusively for the specified educational expenses.
Charter School: Although charter schools typically operate under different funding mechanisms, those that qualify as local educational agencies and operate early learning programs may indirectly benefit from or be subject to the new allocation of funds. They will need to align their policies with state requirements for professional development expenditures.
County Office of Education: County offices of education, serving as regional administrators, are likely to play a critical role in overseeing the distribution and proper use of funds among school districts (and potentially charter schools) in their counties. This includes ensuring that allocated funds are spent in accordance with the bill’s requirements.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change amends the California School Finance Authority Act by revising how local intercepts are handled for financing projects. It replaces the previous written notice requirement to the Controller with a process where participating parties submit a request to the county treasurer (or appropriate fiscal officer) to have the county participate. In addition, it limits school districts and county offices of education—previously able to intercept payments on short-term financings—to doing so only for indebtedness where repayment is deemed probable. These changes impose new compliance and procedural requirements at the local level, affecting how funding is managed and requiring updates to internal processes.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must now assess and confirm that the repayment of bonds is probable before intercepting payments. They are also required to initiate participation by sending a request to the county treasurer or fiscal officer rather than providing written notice to the Controller.
County Office of Education: County offices of education, similar to school districts, face a restriction on intercepting payments only for cases with probable repayment. They must coordinate with county fiscal officers for the local intercept process.
County: Counties are now directly involved as they are required to process requests from participating parties. If a county agrees to participate, its treasurer or fiscal officer must perform an apportionment or revenue transfer, necessitating updates to internal revenue transfer and compliance procedures.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The bill extends the period during which a longstanding state-mandated proration funding formula is not applied. For fiscal years starting with 2023–24, the calculation method for distributing state support among school districts, community college districts, and direct state instructional services will remain inapplicable. Affected local agencies need to adjust their budgeting and financial planning processes in light of this change.

                       School District: School districts will no longer have funding determined by the proration calculation for fiscal year 2023–24. This requires reviewing budget forecasts, adjusting cash flow management, and potentially revising internal financial planning processes to accommodate an altered funding distribution method.
Community College: Community colleges will similarly face a change in how state funds are allocated, as the proration calculation previously used will not apply for fiscal year 2023–24. This means updating budget planning processes and ensuring compliance with any new state funding formulas or guidelines.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The bill establishes a new $300 million annual appropriation under the Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier apportionment starting in the 2023–24 fiscal year. It mandates that eligible local educational agencies receive funding based on each schoolsite’s prior year adjusted cumulative enrollment, with a guarantee of at least $50,000 per schoolsite. This change affects how funds are allocated and requires updated enrollment reporting and compliance measures. Although primarily directed at school districts and charter schools, county-level education offices may also face indirect oversight responsibilities.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts must implement the new funding formula which allocates funds on a per-unit basis using the prior year’s adjusted cumulative enrollment. They must ensure that each eligible schoolsite receives a minimum of $50,000 annually and update their reporting and recordkeeping systems accordingly. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: Charter Schools, as eligible local educational agencies, are directly impacted by the new allocation formula. They must accurately document prior year enrollment figures and adjust budgeting practices to reflect the mandated minimum annual funding per schoolsite. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which oversee county superintendent functions and provide support to school districts and charter schools, may be indirectly affected. They will need to assist in monitoring compliance, ensuring accurate reporting, and supporting the adoption of the new funding requirements. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)

                       The bill amends state apportionment rules by changing the funding formulas used for local educational agencies. For the 2022–23 fiscal year, school districts must incorporate an additional allocation equal to 12.5% of the attendance difference calculated from the 2020–21 fiscal year decline due to an emergency. While charter schools and county offices of education continue to follow existing attendance estimation and documentation requirements, school districts face a direct change that will affect budgeting and financial planning.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: For the 2022–23 fiscal year, school districts must adjust their local control funding formulas to add an amount equal to 12.5% of the difference computed from the 2020–21 fiscal year&#39;s attendance decline due to an emergency. This change requires agencies to update their budgeting processes, recalculation methodologies, and supporting documentation to ensure compliance with state funding guidelines. (Deadline: July 01, 2022)
Charter School: Charter schools must accurately estimate and report average daily attendance and document any emergency‐related declines as stipulated by existing law. Although no new allocation percentage is introduced for charter schools, they must continue to comply with established procedures to ensure proper funding.
County Office of Education: County offices of education are indirectly impacted as they must adhere to state guidelines for estimating average daily attendance when emergencies reduce enrollment. They are required to document these changes per existing law, ensuring that funding apportionments are correctly computed.

This affects local School Districts that had schools destroyed by the 2021 state of emergency, as they must continue to report attendance and teacher data as if the destroyed school remained operational. County Offices of Education are indirectly impacted as they provide oversight and coordination for compliance.

                       The legislative change narrows which local educational agencies may seek advice and assistance from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence by requiring that only those eligible for certain technical assistance can make such requests. Additionally, it authorizes a county-level fiscal crisis team to request these services and mandates that any agency that uses these services must reimburse the Collaborative for its costs under the annual Budget Act. This affects local agencies by imposing new eligibility criteria and reimbursement compliance requirements.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change amends the Community Engagement Initiative Expansion by requiring that partnerships under the initiative include provisions for providing fiscal support to partner organizations. This new requirement affects local agencies—primarily those in the K-12 education system—by mandating updates to partnership agreements, budget allocations, and oversight processes. Although the primary focus is on school districts and county offices of education, charter schools may also be indirectly impacted through changes in district policies and funding reallocations.

                       School District: School districts participating in the Community Engagement Initiative must now ensure that their partnership agreements include a mandate to provide fiscal support to partner organizations. This change will require reviewing existing contracts, adjusting budget planning, and possibly re-negotiating terms with partner organizations. (Deadline: July 01, 2022)
County Office of Education: County offices of education, which may be selected as the lead agency or otherwise involved in the collaborative, must update their oversight procedures to ensure that any partnership under the initiative includes the new fiscal support element. This may involve developing new compliance and reporting mechanisms. (Deadline: July 01, 2022)
Charter School: Although not directly named in the partnership requirements, charter schools may be indirectly affected if their authorizing school districts adjust policies and budget allocations to meet the new fiscal support mandates. They should monitor district-level changes that could affect operational and funding priorities.

                       This legislative change extends the period during which $15 million in funds can be encumbered from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2025. The funds are designated for use by the Superintendent and the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to designate a County Office of Education that will identify and curate a repository of high-quality open educational resources for local educational agencies. As a result, the designated County Office of Education must adjust its operational timelines to meet the new deadline, and local school districts and charter schools—who will ultimately benefit from access to these resources—may need to plan for integrating the new materials into their curricula.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       County Office of Education: The County Office of Education is directly impacted as it is designated to curate and manage the repository of open educational resources. They must update their project plans and timelines to reflect the extended encumbrance period, ensuring compliance with the new June 30, 2025 deadline. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
School District: School Districts, as local educational agencies, will indirectly benefit from the repository. They may need to review and incorporate these high-quality open educational resources into their instructional programs.
Charter School: Charter Schools, which operate as local educational agencies, stand to gain access to the curated open educational resources from the repository. They should assess how these resources can be aligned with their instructional needs.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change restructures funding for replacing heavy‐duty internal combustion school buses with zero-emission models and for upgrading related charging/fueling infrastructure. Instead of providing recurring annual grants, the law now appropriates one-time funds for the 2023–24 fiscal year. This change affects local educational agencies—predominantly School Districts—that own school buses, requiring them to adjust their grant application processes, capital planning, and project implementation timelines.

                       School District: School Districts, as local educational agencies that own heavy‐duty internal combustion school buses, will now receive one-time grant funds (rather than recurring annual grants) for zero-emission bus replacements and related infrastructure projects. This requires them to replan fleet replacement strategies and infrastructure upgrades to align with the available funding for the 2023–24 fiscal year while recognizing that ongoing funding may not be provided in subsequent years.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The Budget Act of 2023 appropriates funds from the Federal Trust Fund to support local educational agencies in implementing Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS). The bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to competitively award grants (subject to state board approval) to eligible agencies, mandating that funds be used to create safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments through integrated academic, behavioral, and social emotional strategies. This change creates both direct and indirect compliance, funding, and operational requirements for affected agencies.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts are directly impacted as they are eligible to compete for grant funds to implement MTSS initiatives. They must adjust their programs to incorporate integrated academic, behavioral, and social emotional learning practices and comply with both federal program guidelines and state oversight requirements.
Charter School: If Charter Schools are deemed eligible as local educational agencies, they may indirectly benefit from this funding stream. They will need to review their eligibility and adjust their operational practices to meet MTSS requirements and related state oversight, even if the impact is less direct than for traditional school districts.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide support and oversight to school districts, will be indirectly affected. They are likely to play a key role in assisting districts with grant applications, compliance monitoring, and the implementation of MTSS activities.

                       The bill appropriates additional General Fund resources to augment special education funding as set out in the Budget Act of 2023. The additional funds will only be available if the revenues distributed to local educational agencies for special education programs fall short of the estimated amount. The mechanism requires the Director of Finance to assess and adjust the appropriation by June 30, 2024, creating new compliance requirements and potential funding adjustments for local agencies.

                       School District: School Districts must ensure that the special education revenue data they submit is accurate and timely. If the actual revenues from successor agencies are less than the estimated amount in the Budget Act of 2023, they will receive additional funds. Conversely, if revenues exceed the estimate, the appropriation will be reduced accordingly. This requires updated financial forecasts, revised budgeting for special education programs, and enhanced reporting procedures. (Deadline: June 30, 2024)
Charter School: If Charter Schools are classified as local educational agencies for the purpose of special education funding, they will be indirectly affected by the funding mechanism. They need to monitor the revenue figures related to special education programs and adjust their budgets in anticipation of possible changes in available state funds, based on the Director of Finance’s determination by June 30, 2024.

                       This legislative change clarifies the state&#39;s constitutional obligation to reimburse local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by state law. Once the Commission on State Mandates determines that a bill imposes state‐mandated expenses, affected local agencies will be eligible for reimbursement under established statutory procedures. Local agencies—including educational, municipal, and other local governmental bodies—should review their expense tracking and documentation practices to ensure compliance.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts will receive state reimbursement for costs imposed by state mandates once the Commission on State Mandates confirms that the act contains such mandates. They must ensure that all incurred costs are properly documented per statutory procedures.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which support local school districts, may also be eligible to claim reimbursement for expenditures arising from state mandates, thereby aligning with the constitutional requirement.
City: Cities, as local governmental agencies, could face costs imposed by state mandates and thus should be prepared to seek reimbursement following the determined guidelines.
County: Counties will also be impacted if state mandates impose additional costs. They need to align budgeting and documentation practices with the new reimbursement provisions to ensure recovery of these costs.
Special District: Special Districts that provide targeted services and incur state-mandated costs should prepare to document these expenses to qualify for reimbursement under the new provisions.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, which involve collaborations among multiple local agencies, may jointly incur state mandated costs and will need to coordinate their reimbursement claims accordingly.

                       The bill directs that certain appropriated funds be applied toward meeting the constitutional minimum funding requirements for both K-12 school districts and community college districts. This allocation provides a new funding stream that will require affected local agencies to adjust budgeting procedures and compliance protocols to align with the constitutional mandate set forth in Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.

This may require a review and realignment of current budgeting practices as well as updated compliance and reporting processes to ensure adherence to funding requirements.
Community College: Community College districts will similarly benefit from funds applied toward satisfying the minimum funding mandates. They will need to adjust their financial planning and ensure that systems are in place to document compliance with the constitutional requirements.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change delays the statewide workgroup’s reporting of recommendations for enhancing California’s state preschool program from January 15, 2023 to March 31, 2024 and requires that the State Department of Education issue local implementation guidance by December 31, 2023. Although the change is made at the state level, it indirectly impacts local agencies—particularly those operating or overseeing state preschool programs—by shifting compliance and planning timelines and mandating new quality improvement measures.

                       School District: School Districts that operate contracted state preschool programs will need to adjust their operational plans and resource allocations to align with the new quality improvement guidance. The delayed report deadline means planning and policy adjustments will be extended, requiring re-coordination with state directives. (Deadline: March 31, 2024)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, serving as representatives in the statewide workgroup, must coordinate with school districts and other local stakeholders to integrate the new quality improvement measures. The extended timeline will affect how they oversee and support local preschool programs. (Deadline: March 31, 2024)

                       The legislative change amends the After School Education and Safety Program by requiring that any local educational agency (typically a School District) contracting with a third party for before and after school programs must include specific provisions in its contracts. These provisions mandate that the third party notify the agency of any designated health or safety issues and obtain pupil health information from parents/guardians. While School Districts are directly impacted, cities, counties, and county offices of education that partner with or support school districts in this program may also face indirect compliance and coordination challenges.

                       School District: School Districts, acting as local educational agencies, must revise their contracts with third-party providers to include clauses requiring notification of health or safety issues and the collection of pupil health information from parents/guardians. This change increases their administrative oversight and compliance responsibilities.
City: Cities that participate in the program (through partnerships or grant applications with School Districts) may need to align local policies and coordinate with school districts to ensure that revised contractual provisions are implemented effectively.
County: Counties involved in the program either as grant applicants or as partners with School Districts must ensure that any contractual changes imposed by the local educational agencies are adhered to, and may need to set up monitoring mechanisms for third party compliance.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide regional support to School Districts, may be required to offer guidance and develop advisory materials to help districts effectively update contracts and comply with the new health and safety provisions.

                       The legislative change revises the school district uniform complaint process for teacher misassignment by lowering the threshold for triggering a complaint from classes with more than 20% English learner pupils to any class with one or more English learner pupils. This expands the scope of the process and constitutes a state-mandated local program, directly impacting school districts and indirectly affecting county offices of education that oversee and support district compliance.

                       School District: School districts must update their uniform complaint process to address teacher misassignment complaints when even a single English learner is present. This lower threshold may increase the volume of complaints and require additional administrative resources, documentation revisions, and staff training.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may need to enhance their oversight and support protocols to ensure that school districts effectively implement and comply with the updated uniform complaint process. This might include providing technical assistance and monitoring implementation progress.

                       The bill prohibits the state board from waiving any part of the education laws related to transitional kindergarten and kindergarten admission. This change removes the ability of school districts and county boards of education (as represented by the County Office of Education) to request modifications to state-mandated admission rules. Affected agencies will need to update their policies and procedures to ensure strict compliance with the state requirements.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts no longer have the option to request a waiver from state-level rules governing transitional kindergarten and kindergarten admissions. They must adopt and enforce the state-prescribed guidelines without exception.
County Office of Education: County boards of education, typically administered via the County Office of Education, lose the authority to ask for state board waivers regarding transitional kindergarten and kindergarten admissions. They must align local procedures with the state law, eliminating previous flexibility.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change revises how juvenile court schools and associated programs operate by mandating expedited intake evaluations for wards entering local juvenile facilities, requiring timely transfer of transition plans upon re‐enrollment in local educational agencies, imposing annual reporting and independent evaluation requirements, and updating partnership protocols for postsecondary course access. These changes create new, time-sensitive compliance obligations and collaborative processes that impact several local agency types directly and indirectly.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts, as the postplacement local educational agencies, must update their enrollment processes to accept transition plans that are prepared and transferred within 2 business days of a youth’s reenrollment. They will need to work with county agencies to adjust existing MOUs to integrate the new joint intake evaluation processes.
Charter School: Charter schools, as potential destinations for reenrolled youth, must adapt their enrollment and administrative practices to comply with the mandated rapid transfer of transition plans and participate in collaborative interagency processes as specified in the updated agreements.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which administer juvenile court schools, are required to convene a workgroup—including representatives from school districts, charter schools, and other agencies—to examine the education of pupils with disabilities in juvenile court schools. They also must facilitate the independent evaluation process and coordinate reporting efforts.
County: County-level entities, particularly county probation departments, must now collaborate with the county office of education and higher education institutions to ensure that detained or committed juveniles have access to rigorous postsecondary academic and technical courses. This expanded role also applies to secure youth treatment facilities.
Community College: Community Colleges, identified as key partners in providing online and career technical courses, must be prepared to collaborate under the revised framework. They may need to adjust their course offerings and scheduling to align with the new partnership requirements with county probation and county educational agencies.

                       This legislative change appropriates $3.5 million from the General Fund for the State Department of Education to allocate funds to county offices of education. The funds are designated to purchase and maintain emergency opioid antagonists at school sites, with a requirement that each middle school, junior high school, high school, and adult school site maintain a minimum of two units. County offices must coordinate the procurement and distribution of these supplies, impacting them directly, and consequently, school districts and charter schools must comply with these operational and safety protocols.

                       This legislative change expands the LCAP posting requirements by imposing new duties on both school district and county office superintendents. School district superintendents must now post on their websites LCAPs approved not only by the local governing board but also by the county superintendent, while county office superintendents must post LCAPs approved by the county board of education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. This new state-mandated program creates additional compliance obligations for the affected local agencies.

County Office of Education: County office superintendents must now post LCAPs that have been approved by both the county board of education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction on the county office website, requiring coordination between offices and an update to current posting procedures.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change expands an existing LCAP support summary requirement—previously applicable only to county superintendents overseeing multiple school districts—to now include those with jurisdiction over a single school district. This effectively creates a new state-mandated local program that compels affected county offices of education to prepare, present, and submit an annual report detailing how they support school districts and schools in implementing Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAPs). As a result, not only will the county office of education face direct compliance obligations, but school districts may also experience indirect operational impacts due to altered county oversight and support practices.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       County Office of Education: County superintendents, even in counties with a single school district, are now required to prepare, present, and include an LCAP support summary with their annual LCAP submission. This change broadens their responsibilities and imposes additional administrative and compliance tasks that were previously not required in single-district counties.
School District: School districts may be indirectly affected as the new reporting mandate could lead to changes in the support structures and oversight procedures managed by the county office of education. Closer coordination with the county may be necessary to align on the changes in LCAP support and implementation strategies.

                       The legislative change amends Education Code Section 52070 by mandating that school districts and county offices of education meeting certain criteria update their Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAP) to include specific actions and services for technical assistance aimed at improving pupil outcomes. This additional requirement effectively imposes a state-mandated local program, increasing compliance and administrative obligations for these agencies.

                       The bill modifies existing mandates by requiring county superintendents to provide extended technical assistance to school districts under certain conditions. Specifically, school districts that meet designated pupil subgroup performance criteria or that fail to submit required data will trigger a mandatory 2‐year technical assistance period; additionally, if a district underperforms for 3 or more consecutive years, its designated geographic lead agency must work with the county superintendent to deliver assistance. This creates a state-mandated local program affecting both school districts and county education offices.

                       School District: School districts that meet certain pupil subgroup performance criteria or fail to submit required data will be subject to a state-mandated technical assistance program that lasts a minimum of 2 years. They must adjust internal processes for data reporting and performance improvement as the new criteria trigger additional oversight.
County Office of Education: County superintendents, operating within the County Office of Education, are now required to provide extended technical assistance to qualifying school districts. They must offer a minimum of 2 years of support, address noncompliance in data submission, and collaborate with the school district’s geographic lead agency for districts with prolonged underperformance.

                       This bill amends Education Code Section 52071.5 to impose an extended technical assistance requirement on county offices of education. Under the new law, if one or more specified pupil subgroups meet certain performance criteria or if a county office fails to submit required data, the Superintendent must provide technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years. This heightened oversight creates new compliance obligations and may indirectly affect related accountability processes.

                       The legislative change revises the intervention framework for underperforming K-12 public education agencies in California. It establishes two distinct intervention processes by requiring the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to first consult with school districts and county offices of education before the Superintendent—subject to state board approval—can mandate corrective actions such as revisions to the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and budgets. Additionally, charter schools are included in the advisory scope, indirectly affecting them through enhanced guidance.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must now actively engage with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to assess if technical assistance is needed. If they consistently fail to implement recommended changes or meet performance rubric criteria over three of four consecutive years, the Superintendent—pending state board approval—may intervene. This includes imposing revisions to the LCAP and budget.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education are subject to similar new duties as school districts. They must collaborate with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to determine their need for assistance. Persistent or acute inadequate performance based on the established rubric can trigger intervention requiring changes to their operational plans and budget revisions.
Charter School: Charter schools are included within the advisory and assistance framework of the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. Although they are not directly subject to the intervention process, they may receive enhanced guidance aimed at aligning their local control and accountability practices with state goals.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change creates a state‐mandated program requiring local educational agencies serving Kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2 pupils to adopt approved screening instruments for early detection of reading difficulties and to provide supports and services to students identified as at risk. In addition, the bill appropriates funds for a zero‐emission schoolbus replacement program for agencies that own heavy‐duty internal combustion schoolbuses, thereby affecting local agencies through both direct compliance requirements and funding opportunities.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts must adopt one or more state‐approved screening instruments for Kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2 pupils by June 30, 2025. They are required to initiate annual screening beginning with the 2025–26 school year and to provide necessary supports for students identified as at risk of reading difficulties. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
Charter School: Charter Schools serving pupils in Kindergarten through Grade 2 may need to comply with the state mandate by adopting one or more approved screening instruments and implementing annual screening protocols, subject to their governing structure. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, while not directly mandated to adopt screening instruments, are likely to provide guidance, technical assistance, and monitoring support to School Districts and Charter Schools to ensure compliance with the new screening and support requirements.
School District: School Districts that own heavy-duty internal combustion schoolbuses are eligible for funding under the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Voucher Incentive Project. This program, running over five years from the 2023–24 fiscal year, assists districts in replacing traditional schoolbuses with zero-emission alternatives in accordance with program guidelines.
Charter School: Charter Schools that operate schoolbuses may benefit from the zero-emission schoolbus replacement funding. They must ensure that they meet eligibility requirements, submit the necessary applications, and plan the replacement of eligible buses in line with program guidelines.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change revises California’s Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialists Grant Program. It expands reporting obligations for recipient local educational agencies by requiring interim reports in addition to the final report, and mandates that both sets of reports be forwarded by the Superintendent to a designated independent evaluator. The bill also prohibits using these funds for the salaries of existing literacy coaches and reading specialists and appropriates additional funds to include eligible schoolsites that were not part of the initial program. This impacts agencies directly involved in K-12 education funding and indirectly those involved in program oversight.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts, as primary local educational agencies receiving the grant funds, must now submit interim reports in addition to the final report (due by June 30, 2027), ensure that funds are used solely for new initiatives rather than supporting existing literacy staff salaries, and align budgeting and administrative practices to meet independent evaluation requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Charter School: Charter Schools that qualify as local educational agencies or that operate under oversight arrangements may become eligible for these funds and will need to comply with the added reporting requirements and funding restrictions if they receive grant money.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which often provide support and oversight to School Districts, may have a coordinating role in assisting local agencies with the enhanced reporting process and ensuring adherence to the new funding restrictions and evaluation procedures.

                       This legislative change establishes the Diverse Education Leaders Pipeline Initiative program by directing state funding to be used for grants aimed at local educational agencies to develop diverse, culturally responsive administrators for transitional kindergarten through grade 12. In exchange for a grant (up to $30,000 per candidate), the awarded administrator candidate must sign a written agreement to serve at least two school years in a public school. The change imposes new processes and compliance measures on local agencies and requires that a program report be submitted by June 30, 2027.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts are the primary recipients of grant funds under this initiative. They must update recruitment and training programs to incorporate a new process for selecting, training, and retaining diverse administrators, including ensuring that candidates sign a service commitment for at least two years.
Charter School: As independent public educational agencies, Charter Schools may also be eligible to receive these grant funds. They must assess their leadership recruitment strategies and ensure that any administrator candidate funded under the program agrees to the mandatory two-year service requirement.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, while not direct grant recipients, may experience indirect impacts by providing technical assistance and oversight to School Districts and Charter Schools. They could be called upon to help local agencies understand and implement the new grant, training, and compliance requirements.

                       The bill extends the period during which appropriated funds under the California Preschool, Transitional Kindergarten, and Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program can be encumbered or expended. This change primarily benefits School Districts by providing an extended window to construct new or retrofit existing facilities for transitional kindergarten and full-day kindergarten classrooms. As a result, affected school districts must update their project plans, budgeting, and financial reporting procedures to align with the revised timelines.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislative change revises the eligibility criteria and definitions governing two significant funding streams — a $600 million appropriation for kitchen infrastructure upgrades and a $100 million appropriation for implementing school food best practices — aimed at enhancing the quality of meals served under federal meal programs. These revisions require local educational agencies to adjust project planning, procurement processes, and compliance protocols to align with newly defined standards for freshly prepared onsite meals and updated best practices.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts receiving a portion of the $600M and $100M appropriations must update their kitchen infrastructure projects and meal program operations to comply with the revised definitions and best practices. They need to review and adjust their project proposals and procurement processes to ensure that expenditures meet the updated eligibility criteria for serving fresh, minimally processed, and sustainably sourced meals.
County Office of Education: County offices of education, responsible for advising and coordinating with local educational agencies, will need to ensure that the changes to school food best practices and meal definitions are clearly communicated and implemented. They may also be tasked with monitoring compliance and assisting districts in aligning their projects with the state’s revised guidelines.
Charter School: Charter schools that are eligible for a share of the appropriated funds must update their operational and capital improvement plans to incorporate the newly defined criteria for freshly prepared onsite meals and revised best practices for school food programs.

                       School District: School districts receiving allocations from the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund will see their appropriations reduced by approximately $1.59 billion. They are required to submit an interim expenditure report by December 15, 2024, followed by annual interim reports, and a final report by December 15, 2029, thereby affecting budgeting and program management for learning recovery initiatives. (Deadline: December 15, 2024)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, as key allocators of the fund, must adjust to the reduced funding and adhere to the new reporting schedule. This impacts their oversight of learning recovery efforts and requires adjustments in financial controls and annual reporting procedures. (Deadline: December 15, 2024)
Charter School: Charter schools that receive allocations under the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund will face reduced appropriations and a modified reporting timeline. They must update their compliance and reporting structures to meet the new deadlines, affecting financial management and recovery program execution. (Deadline: December 15, 2024)
Community College: Although community colleges were mentioned in the broader scope of eligible agencies for the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund, funding allocations have primarily targeted K–12 schools, county offices, and charter schools. Community colleges may experience indirect impacts if state policy evolves to include them or if similar reporting standards are later applied.

                       The legislative change eliminates the requirement that the Controller’s audit guide include procedures for detecting unspent funds related to specific educational facilities projects. This deletion impacts how local educational agencies monitor and report the use of state funds for Charter School Facilities, Career Technical Education Facilities, and hardship-funded projects. As a result, affected agencies must review and update their internal controls to compensate for the loss of state-mandated guidance.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts that receive state funds under the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act will no longer have audit guide instructions to help detect unspent funds. They must therefore enhance their internal audit and compliance measures to ensure accurate tracking and reporting of expenditures on facilities projects.
Charter School: Charter Schools involved in the Charter School Facilities Program will lose the benefit of state-provided audit procedures for detecting unspent funds. This necessitates the development of robust internal financial controls and tracking procedures to maintain fiscal accountability.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which support and oversee local educational agencies, may face indirect impacts. They might need to provide enhanced advisory and monitoring services to School Districts and Charter Schools adjusting to the revised state oversight environment.

                       The bill eliminates eligibility for a state transportation allowance for school districts that have an approved districtwide charter petition. Under existing law, school districts (or county superintendents) that provide transportation services must develop and adopt a detailed transportation plan to receive an allowance equal to 60% of their reported home‐to‐school transportation expenditures. This change forces school districts considering conversion into a charter system to reassess their operational and financial planning, while charter schools in such districts may indirectly face new transportation funding challenges.

                       School District: School districts that obtain an approved districtwide charter petition will no longer qualify for the transportation allowance. Affected school districts must either refrain from converting if they wish to retain the funding or develop alternative funding strategies to cover transportation service obligations. They will also need to revisit their transportation service plans in light of this funding loss.
Charter School: In cases where a school district converts entirely to a charter model through an approved districtwide charter petition, the schools—operating as charter schools—will be indirectly affected by the loss of coordinated transportation allowance.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change revises educator assignment monitoring, reporting, and oversight by broadening the data requirements and establishing new compliance standards for local educational agencies. It mandates that the state department provide detailed educator assignment data (including preliminary, intern credentials, permits, waivers, misassignments, and vacancies) to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and requires that results of the assignment monitoring process be accessible to local agencies. In addition, the bill expands the commission’s authority to impose sanctions on agencies that consistently misassign educators and changes the criteria for listing non‐compliant schools, thereby creating new duties for county superintendents and local agencies. While the immediate deadlines pertain to transcript review process recommendations by the commission, local agencies will ultimately need to adjust their reporting and compliance systems accordingly.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must update their educator assignment reporting processes to capture a broader range of credential types and to provide data to state systems. They will also be subject to potential sanctions if found to consistently misassign educators and must adjust internal policies in response to new state-mandated oversight.
Charter School: Charter schools, as local educational agencies, must comply with the revised educator assignment rules. They are required to accurately report detailed educator credential data and may face sanctions for persistent misassignments, necessitating a review and update of their internal policies.
County Office of Education: County offices of education will need to support school districts by facilitating the updated data reporting, ensuring access to state accountability system results, and coordinating the new inspection and reporting processes mandated by the Superintendent’s list.

                       This legislative change revises California’s Expanded Learning Opportunities Program by adding specific licensing requirements depending on whether a local educational agency operates the program directly or contracts with a third-party provider. It also mandates that the Superintendent, in consultation with the State Department of Social Services, establish a process and timeline for local agencies when contracting with off‐campus providers, and requires annual submission of program access information by state preschool providers. Additionally, the bill modifies funding expenditure periods for school districts and charter schools, which will necessitate adjustments in financial planning and compliance procedures.

                       School District: School districts that operate expanded learning programs must update their program plans to meet new licensing requirements. They will also need to adjust contracting procedures when engaging third-party providers for off-campus programs and adhere to revised reporting guidelines.
Charter School: Charter schools are authorized to expend funds over an extended period (from fiscal year 2021–22 through 2023–24) under the revised provisions. They must also comply with the new licensing and reporting requirements when providing expanded learning opportunities, particularly if they contract with third-party providers.

                       The bill revises transitional kindergarten program requirements for School Districts and Charter Schools. It delays the mandated adult-to-pupil ratio requirement until the 2025–26 school year and extends the deadline for teacher credential compliance to August 1, 2025. Additionally, for early enrollment children, the bill establishes temporary conditions requiring concurrent enrollment in a state preschool program (if available) and imposes reporting obligations for the 2023–24 and 2024–25 school years. These changes, while providing additional time for compliance, necessitate program policy updates, tighter administrative coordination, and proactive planning for funding and staffing.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must adjust their transitional kindergarten operations. The requirement to maintain at least one adult per 10 pupils is delayed until the 2025–26 school year and is no longer contingent on appropriation of funds. Districts must also ensure that teachers newly assigned to transitional kindergarten meet designated credentialing criteria by August 1, 2025. For early enrollment children, districts offering such programs must simultaneously provide access to a state preschool program (if not fully subscribed) and comply with new reporting requirements.
Charter School: Charter schools operating transitional kindergarten programs face similar delays and updated compliance obligations as school districts. They must adhere to the postponed staffing ratio and revised teacher credential deadlines. Additionally, charter schools that enroll early enrollment children must offer a concurrent state preschool program if applicable and report specified information to the State Department of Education on set deadlines, with early enrollment pupils excluded from attendance counts until they turn five.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change revises the Charter Schools Act to modify the appeals process for charter school petitions, extend and adjust charter school term renewals, and shift the criteria for classifying acquiring versus continuing charter schools. Additionally, it extends the prohibition on approving nonclassroom‐based charter school petitions and mandates a report on funding determination processes. These changes impose new compliance, operational, and reporting requirements on local educational agencies and charter schools.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts acting as chartering authorities must update their appeal procedures for charter petitions. Under the new law, for the state board to reverse a denial, there must be an abuse of discretion by both the school district and the county board, which necessitates enhanced documentation and review protocols.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, serving as chartering authorities or appeal bodies, must adjust their protocols to comply with the revised requirement that both the school district and county board actions be scrutinized separately. They also need to implement the updated term renewal procedures for charter schools.
Charter School: Charter schools are directly affected by new term extension rules. Schools with terms expiring between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2025 will be extended by 2 years, and those expiring between January 1, 2024 and June 30, 2027 will receive an additional one-year extension. The change in the continuing/acquiring status deadline (from July 1, 2025 to July 1, 2026) will also affect funding eligibility and operational planning.
County: The County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, a county-level entity, must compile and submit a report on the processes used to determine funding for nonclassroom-based charter schools. This indirect requirement affects county fiscal oversight and reporting process. (Deadline: March 01, 2024)

                       The legislative change shifts the meal reimbursement process by requiring the State Department of Education to directly provide reimbursements for reduced‐price and paid meals to local agencies. This replaces the previous system in which the department reimbursed school districts or county superintendents for expenses related to free meal provision. As a result, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools must now meet federal program participation criteria and comply with new state guidelines to receive reimbursement.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change revises the state-adopted LCAP template and instructions, affecting local educational agencies by imposing new compliance requirements. Local entities—school districts, charter schools, and county offices of education—must now document a more detailed stakeholder engagement process (specifically including stakeholders from schools receiving Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier funding) and include mandatory remedial actions when schools or pupil groups record the lowest performance on state indicators. These modifications create a state-mandated local program for LCAPs, with new actions required starting from the 2024–25 plan cycle.

                       The legislative change imposes additional reporting requirements on local educational agencies. School districts, county offices of education, and charter schools must now produce and present a combined report on the annual update to the LCAP and the local control funding formula budget overview. County offices of education in particular must update their reports to separately detail add-on funding streams for juvenile court schools, county community schools, and the Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant. These changes create a state-mandated local program that affects meeting schedules, reporting templates, and internal processes.

                       The legislative change amends Education Code Section 52052 to require that the single multiple measures public school accountability system separately measure the performance of both English learners and long-term English learners. This adjustment creates new reporting and evaluation duties for local educational agencies, making it a state-mandated local program. Local agencies must update their data collection systems, evaluation rubrics, and reporting procedures to comply with the enhanced accountability requirements.

                       School District: School districts will need to modify their data systems and evaluation rubrics to separately track and report the performance outcomes of long-term English learners in addition to existing measures for English learners.
Charter School: Charter schools are required to adjust their accountability measures by distinguishing between English learners and long-term English learners, leading to increased administrative responsibilities in data management and reporting.
County Office of Education: County offices of education, which provide oversight and support services to school districts, will be responsible for guiding and monitoring the implementation of separate performance metrics for English learners and long-term English learners across the districts they serve.

                       The legislative change mandates that performance data on state and local indicators be publicly reported via the California School Dashboard by specified deadlines for the prior school year. In addition, the timelines for collecting data through the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System are to be adjusted to support these reporting dates. This change creates new compliance and reporting duties for local educational agencies, requiring them to update internal data collection processes and coordinate with state education officials.

                       School District: Local school districts must modify their internal data reporting processes to meet newly established deadlines for public reporting via the California School Dashboard. They will need to adjust their data submission schedules in line with the updated timelines from the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education will play a coordinating role by ensuring that performance data collected from school districts and charter schools is submitted in accordance with the new public reporting dates. They must also establish or update procedures to support the adjusted timelines of the Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System.
Charter School: Charter schools are directly impacted, as they must comply with the new public reporting deadlines and adjust their evaluation processes based on the newly adopted rubrics and timeline changes. Their internal data systems will need to be updated for timely reporting via the Dashboard.

                       The legislative change mandates that by March 1, 2024, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence together with the Department of Education must select, through a competitive process and subject to approval by the executive director of the state board, local educational agencies or a consortium thereof to serve as Equity Leads. These Equity Leads will be responsible for developing and disseminating resources on best practices for program analysis, identifying barriers and opportunities, and implementing strategies to address racial disparities. The initiative targets agencies serving K–12 students – including school districts and charter schools – with special priority for those with schools receiving Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier funding. Additionally, funds from the General Fund will be appropriated each fiscal year starting with 2023–24 to support these activities.

Eligible local educational agencies must now comply with updated reporting deadlines and participate in quarterly meetings with the state department, while a structured funding stream is established from 2023–24 to 2027–28.

                       The legislative change revises Education Code Section 60900.5 to expand the California College Guidance Initiative (CCGI) services from solely school districts to all local educational agencies. It also modifies notification requirements so that the department must alert local agencies about the additional use of CalPADS data and advise them to include corresponding disclosures in their annual parent notifications under FERPA.

Charter School: By redefining eligibility, charter schools are now covered as local educational agencies that can access CCGI services. They must also update their annual parent notification protocols to include the new data usage disclosures.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which oversee multiple local agencies, need to ensure that school districts and charter schools under their jurisdiction comply with the enhanced notification requirements and effectively implement CCGI services.

                       The legislative change reduces the state appropriation for certain charter schools from $413,000,000 to $290,023,000 for the 2022–23 fiscal year. This funding cut has a direct financial impact on Charter Schools and indirect impacts on agencies involved in charter school oversight, such as School Districts and County Offices of Education. Affected agencies will need to reassess budget planning, adjust operational strategies, and coordinate with legal and financial experts to ensure continued compliance with state funding guidelines.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       Charter School: The bill reduces the funding available to charter schools by $122,977,000, lowering the appropriation from $413,000,000 to $290,023,000. This direct reduction is likely to force charter schools to reexamine their budgets, scale back initiatives, and manage resource constraints during the 2022–23 fiscal year.
School District: School districts that authorize or oversee charter schools may face indirect consequences if charter schools struggle with the funding shortfall. This could lead to a need for enhanced oversight, reallocation of local resources, and potential adjustments in partnership or contractual arrangements with charter schools.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which sometimes provide support and oversight for charter schools, could be indirectly affected by the funding reduction. They may need to modify existing oversight guidelines and assist in mitigating the effects of reduced state funds on charter school operations within their jurisdictions.

                       The legislative change reduces the appropriation for the Arts, Music, and Instructional Materials Discretionary Block Grant for the 2022–23 fiscal year from $3,560,885,000 to $3,360,885,000. This change impacts local agencies that receive these funds—including School Districts, Charter Schools, and County Offices of Education—by lowering the available funding, which may require adjustments in budgeting, allocation procedures, and program planning.

They will need to review and adjust their budgets and resource allocations to comply with the reduced funding.
Charter School: Charter Schools, as direct recipients of the block grant funds, will experience a decrease in their allocated funding, potentially impacting program implementation for arts, music, and instructional support. They should reassess expense allocations and may need to seek alternative funding or cost-saving measures.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, responsible for distributing block grant funds to School Districts and Charter Schools, will have a reduced total fund to allocate. This necessitates an update in their allocation procedures and communication with the affected local agencies.

                       This legislative change provides a $1,000,000 appropriation to the State Department of Education to develop a Literacy Roadmap aimed at enhancing classroom instruction and professional development with an equity focus. Although the funding is state-directed, the change will indirectly affect local public agencies by requiring updates to curriculum frameworks, instructional methods, and teacher training practices.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts will need to review and align their curriculum with the new Literacy Roadmap and update professional development programs for educators in order to comply with state guidelines. This may also require adjustments in local policies and training schedules.
Charter School: Charter Schools, as independent entities receiving public funds, will need to adopt the literacy guidelines set out in the Roadmap. This will mean revising curricular practices and ensuring staff are adequately trained to meet the state’s new literacy standards.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education will play a key role in disseminating the Literacy Roadmap guidelines and supporting local School Districts and Charter Schools. They may be tasked with coordinating regional training, sharing resources, and ensuring consistency in application across jurisdictions.

                       School District: School Districts are directly impacted as they are eligible to receive a portion of the $7 million funding if they adopt the state’s evidence‐based restorative justice best practices. They must review the guidelines, update their disciplinary policies, and implement the practices on school campuses. (Deadline: June 01, 2024)
Charter School: Charter Schools, as local educational agencies, may opt into the program by adopting the state-developed restorative justice practices. They will need to adjust their operational policies accordingly and apply for funding if they choose to participate. (Deadline: June 01, 2024)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, while not direct recipients of the funding, will play a supportive role by advising and assisting School Districts and Charter Schools in the implementation of the new restorative justice practices.

                       The legislative change revises the Teacher Residency Grant Program by expanding service requirements, increasing grant amounts, and instituting a new minimum compensation package for residency candidates. Rather than being limited to serving in the sponsoring local district, candidates must now serve in any public school in California for at least four years. In addition, the grant per candidate is increased from $25,000 to $40,000, with recipients (from the 2023–24 fiscal year onward) required to offer a minimum $20,000 compensation package. The evaluation report deadline is extended to December 1, 2029. These changes indirectly impact local agencies by altering teacher placement, recruitment, budgeting, and oversight requirements.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts will no longer be the exclusive locales for residency candidate placement. As candidates can now choose any public school, districts may see shifts in teacher supply and must update their hiring and integration policies to accommodate candidates sponsored elsewhere.
Charter School: Charter schools, as public educational institutions, may receive residency candidates under the broader statewide service requirement. They will need to review and possibly adapt their employment practices and recruitment strategies to integrate candidates whose sponsorship may come from out-of-district programs.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which support multiple school districts, will have an expanded role in coordinating and overseeing the implementation of the residency program changes. They may need to provide guidance and develop oversight protocols to ensure that the updated service and compensation requirements are uniformly met across districts.

                       The legislative change revises the exemption process for individuals with exceptional needs in local educational agencies. Previously, any student meeting broad eligibility criteria could be exempted from additional coursework. Under the new law, only students who entered the 9th grade in the 2022–23 school year or later qualify, and the eligibility criteria for an alternative diploma pathway have been modified. As a result, local agencies must update policies, procedures, and communications to ensure compliance.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts must revise their exemption and alternative diploma pathway policies to reflect the new eligibility criteria, limiting exemptions to students entering 9th grade in 2022–23 or later. This requires internal policy updates, student record modifications, and adjustments in graduation planning.
Charter School: As independent local educational agencies, Charter Schools will also need to update their exemption processes and alternative diploma pathway guidelines to comply with the new legislative requirements.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide support and oversight to School Districts and Charter Schools, will need to offer guidance and potential technical assistance to ensure proper implementation of the new requirements.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The proposed legislative change extends the prohibition on school districts consolidating special education local plans until July 1, 2026 and mandates new funding allocation calculations for special education local plan areas for the 2023–24 fiscal year. In addition, the Superintendent must post all submitted local plans online. These changes impose additional compliance, budgeting, and administrative duties on local agencies directly involved in special education planning and indirectly on those that are members of such local plan areas.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts are directly affected because the bill extends the prohibition on electing to submit a consolidated special education plan until July 1, 2026, requiring them to maintain separate local plans. Additionally, they must adjust to a new funding allocation formula for the 2023–24 fiscal year and ensure proper submission of these plans for online posting. (Deadline: July 01, 2026)
Charter School: Charter Schools that are member local educational agencies in a special education local plan area may experience indirect impacts, particularly as funding allocation is recalculated and redistributed under the new state-mandated formula.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which may play a role in coordinating multi-agency special education local plan areas, are indirectly affected. They must ensure that compliant funding practices and plan submissions occur among member local agencies.

                       The legislative change requires the Student Aid Commission to provide discrete, individual student data to the California College Guidance Initiative. This data will be used to generate educator reports that help ensure each pupil has completed and submitted the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or California Dream Act Application. As local educational agencies—specifically School Districts, County Offices of Education, and Charter Schools—are defined in the bill, these agencies may face indirect impacts via enhanced monitoring requirements and updated internal tracking and reporting procedures.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts will use the educator reports generated from the new data to monitor and follow up on student aid application submissions. They may need to modify their internal student tracking systems and implement new procedures to address incomplete applications.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education will play a role in supporting local schools by reviewing the educator reports to identify and address gaps in student aid application submissions. They may need to coordinate with school districts and update training for guidance personnel.
Charter School: Charter Schools, as defined local educational agencies, will need to adapt their internal compliance processes to incorporate the new educator reports, ensuring students complete the required financial aid applications.
