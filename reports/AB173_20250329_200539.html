                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislative change mandates that the Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission, identify and prioritize state funding for grade separation projects that risk losing federal and local funding or are facing schedule delays. While the law targets state-level agencies, it indirectly impacts local agencies involved in such projects by altering funding dynamics, oversight, and compliance requirements.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that manage or participate in grade separation projects may face altered funding roles as state funds are reallocated to cover shortfalls. This could lead to adjustments in local budgeting, project planning, and coordination with state agencies.
County: Counties involved in infrastructure projects, including grade separations, need to accommodate changes in financial responsibilities. They may have to adjust local funding commitments and participate in state-led project reviews to ensure continued project viability.
Special District: Special districts that manage transportation or related services may be indirectly affected as state funds become available to support grade separation projects, potentially relieving some local funding pressures but also requiring alignment with state criteria.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by multiple local agencies will need to adapt to new state funding allocation processes. This may involve coordinating shared reporting requirements and revising project governance frameworks to comply with state oversight.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change expands the existing accountability program under the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program to include funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It imposes additional reporting and compliance requirements on regional transportation planning agencies—including updated regional short‐term financial plans and transit operator data submissions—in order to receive state funds in fiscal years 2025–26, 2026–27, and 2027–28. Because regional transportation planning functions are frequently administered by local governmental entities, cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities are indirectly impacted and must modify their internal processes to comply with the new requirements.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities involved as regional transportation planning entities or transit operators will need to update and submit regional short‐term financial plans and transit operator data to secure state funds under the revised accountability program.
County: Counties serving as regional transportation planning agencies or oversight bodies for transit operations must adjust their data submission and reporting processes to remain eligible for funding under the formula-based component.
Special District: Special Districts that manage transit or transportation planning responsibilities are required to update their financial and operational submissions as a condition of receiving funds from the expanded program.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities created by agreements among local agencies to administer regional transportation planning will need to modify their reporting procedures and compliance measures to satisfy the new submission requirements.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The new legislation expands zero‐emission vehicle mandates by requiring the Department of Transportation to report annually on its zero‐emission vehicle acquisitions and performance—effective October 1, 2025, and set to be repealed in 2036. While the reporting requirement targets state agencies, the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation also mandates the transition of local, state, and federal government fleets (including medium‐ and heavy‐duty vehicles) to zero‐emission models. As a result, local agencies must prepare for indirect impacts on their fleet procurement policies, infrastructure investments, and overall compliance strategies.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities with municipal fleets will need to update procurement procedures to incorporate zero‐emission vehicles, plan for new charging/refueling infrastructure, and adjust operational practices as state mandates filter down.
County: Counties operating government fleets must align their vehicle acquisition and maintenance protocols with emerging zero‐emission standards, which may require budget reallocations and long‐term fleet replacement plans.
Special District: Special Districts that manage service or operational fleets could face indirect mandates to transition to zero‐emission vehicles, especially if state funding or program participation becomes contingent on meeting these standards.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, representing collaborations between multiple local agencies, will need to develop a unified approach to transitioning their combined fleets to zero‐emission models to ensure consistent compliance.
School District: Even though school districts primarily focus on education, they may be indirectly impacted if state-level procurement practices evolve to favor zero‐emission vehicles for service fleets such as maintenance trucks or buses that meet heavy-duty criteria.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education might be affected indirectly as updated state mandates influence guidance given to local school districts, potentially altering recommended practices for fleet acquisitions and maintenance of education-related vehicles.
Community College: Community Colleges that operate service fleets for campus security and maintenance may need to reexamine their vehicle policies if state standards drive a shift toward zero‐emission models in public operations.

                       This legislative change permits the state Department of General Services, with the consent of the Department of Motor Vehicles and approval from the Department of Finance, to enter into a lease-purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility replacing a DMV field office in San Francisco. The project may be developed as a mixed-use facility that integrates affordable housing. While the change primarily concerns state agency actions, local governments in San Francisco (both City and County) may be indirectly impacted by adjustments needed in local planning, zoning, and regulatory compliance to accommodate the mixed-use development components and ensure adherence to the Property Acquisition Law and legislative notice requirements.

                       City: Since the facility will be located within the City of San Francisco and may include mixed-use functions that incorporate affordable housing, the city may need to adjust zoning reviews, permitting processes, and local development oversight to align with state project requirements.
County: As the project is also situated within the County of San Francisco, county agencies may be required to coordinate infrastructure, regional planning, and regulatory processes to address any implications arising from the mixed-use development and affordable housing integration.

                       The legislative change adjusts funding requirements for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program. Instead of a fixed allocation of 25% for planning and 75% for implementation, the bill now mandates that up to 25% of available funding may be used for planning with the remainder allocated for implementation. This flexible funding split impacts local agencies involved in infrastructure projects by requiring them to reexamine their budgeting, grant proposals, and compliance practices in line with the revised guidelines.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities planning or partnering on projects to convert underutilized state highways into multimodal corridors must adjust their grant proposals and budget allocations to comply with the new limit of up to 25% for planning. They will need to review proposal formats and internal processes to reflect the revised funding split.
County: County governments involved in these projects or in partnership with other agencies must realign project budgets and grant applications with the flexible funding requirement. This change may affect how counties plan implementation phases and allocate resources for planning and execution.
Special District: Special districts participating in the pilot program may need to modify their approach to grant applications and project budgeting. They must ensure that their project proposals comply with the new funding structure where planning cannot exceed 25% of available funds.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, which allow multiple local agencies to collaborate on common projects, will need to coordinate their joint grant applications under the new funding requirements. They must ensure that the contributions from all partner agencies satisfy the limit on planning expenditures.

                       The legislative change allows lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to request a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation, enabling them to front project costs with their own funds and seek reimbursement later if eligible expenditures are met. This creates new financial flexibility but also imposes additional administrative, compliance, and record-keeping requirements for agencies involved in port-specific projects. The mechanism is temporary, becoming inoperative on 2033-06-30 and repealed on 2034-01-01.

This requires updating financial procedures and application processes. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
County: Counties involved in port and freight infrastructure projects are affected as they must now apply for the new mechanism to use their funds initially, with the expectation of reimbursement once conditions are met. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Special District: Special Districts managing port-specific projects may utilize the new funding approach, allowing them to advance their own capital subject to later repayment. These agencies need to align internal procedures with the program&#39;s compliance requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities engaged in collaborative port projects can take advantage of the advanced funding method. They must ensure effective coordination among member agencies and meet the new reimbursement conditions. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change increases the cap on administrative spending from 2.5% to 5% of the bond proceeds allocated for high‐speed rail development. Although the change is primarily state‑level, it may indirectly affect local public agencies involved in transportation planning, permitting, and coordination. The shift may alter the balance between capital expenditures and administrative costs, prompting local entities to adjust project planning and interagency coordination.

                       City: Cities may need to adjust planning and coordination efforts with state transportation agencies, as the increased administrative allocation could modify the funding available for local feeder projects and connectivity improvements.
County: Counties could see indirect impacts on local infrastructure projects and permitting processes as the reallocation of funds for high‑speed rail projects may affect the capital available for regional improvements.
Special District: Special districts, particularly those involved in transportation or related services, might experience a shift in financing for local projects if a higher portion of bond proceeds is absorbed by increased administrative costs.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that facilitate cooperative local projects may need to revisit and modify interagency agreements to accommodate changes in state administrative oversight and funding reallocation.

Although the program is state‐administered, the changes indirectly impact local agencies involved in transportation planning and infrastructure projects. Local entities such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities may have increased opportunities to access funding, requiring them to update project proposals, ensure compliance with eligibility criteria, and align their planning processes with state deadlines.

They must coordinate with regional planning organizations to ensure their project proposals meet state guidelines and funding deadlines. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
County: Counties, often represented in metropolitan planning agencies, need to update their regional transportation plans and partner with the state to ensure that local projects are eligible for the new funding. Coordination and compliance with state directives are essential. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Special District: Special districts that manage transportation or related infrastructure services can become eligible for project funding under this program. They must adjust internal processes to comply with new state requirements and deadlines. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by local agencies (cities, counties, or special districts) may serve as effective vehicles for pooling resources to bid on active transportation projects. They need to update governance structures and project proposals to align with new state funding provisions. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change expands the oversight role of the High-Speed Rail Authority’s Inspector General by requiring reviews of contract compliance for any public or private entity that receives high-speed rail project funds. It imposes a new contractual requirement—effective for all contracts or amendments executed on or after July 1, 2024—to include provisions granting IG access to records and property. Additionally, it extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees. Although the changes primarily target state-level rail project oversight, local agencies that enter into contracts or receive funds for related projects may be indirectly impacted by new compliance obligations and audit scrutiny.
