                           This legislative change revises the criteria for initiating an Ebony Alert for missing Black youth, adding requirements that the investigating law enforcement agency confirm it has exhausted all available local resources and that useful public information exists to aid in recovery efforts. Once the Department of California Highway Patrol concurs, activation of the alert becomes mandatory. In addition, the department must compile a report on these activities by July 1, 2027. Although the changes focus on law enforcement procedures, they indirectly impact local public agencies—particularly cities and counties whose police or sheriff’s departments are responsible for these determinations—by necessitating updates to protocols and inter-agency coordination.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: City law enforcement units must revise their protocols to ensure that all available local resources have been employed and documented prior to requesting an Ebony Alert. This may involve updating internal procedures and enhancing coordination with other municipal departments.
County: County-level law enforcement, including sheriff’s offices, must adjust their investigative procedures to comply with the new requirement of exhausting all local resources and confirming the availability of actionable information before triggering an Ebony Alert.

                           The bill mandates that the state Secretary of Transportation coordinate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and reallocate available state transportation funds to support grade separation projects. While the change is directed at state agencies and funding processes, local agencies may be indirectly affected if their local funding commitments are jeopardized or if project timelines need to be adjusted. Cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities involved in local infrastructure projects may need to update their local financing strategies and coordinate closely with state entities to ensure compliance and continuity of funding.

                       City: Cities involved in transportation or infrastructure projects may be impacted indirectly if their local funding commitments for grade separation projects are affected by the state reallocation process. They will need to coordinate with state authorities to align project schedules and funding plans.
County: Counties that contribute to or rely on local funding for infrastructure improvements may have to adjust their budgetary and project scheduling processes to accommodate potential shifts in state funding allocations for grade separation projects.
Special District: Special districts responsible for managing specific services, including transportation-related functions, may need to verify or supplement their local funding commitments and adjust project timelines in response to state-driven reallocation for grade separation projects.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that manage regional transportation projects may need to collaborate with state agencies to ensure that local funding inputs and project schedules are in sync with the state’s reallocation process for supporting grade separation projects.

                           The legislative change advances the state&#39;s zero‐emission fleet mandate by establishing new performance and reporting requirements under the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. Although the bill directly targets state agencies’ procurement and reporting—such as the Department of Transportation’s annual submission—the underlying shift toward zero‐emission fleets for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and drayage trucks includes local government fleets as well. Cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities that operate public fleets may be indirectly impacted as state-level guidelines, funding incentives, and compliance benchmarks filter down into local fleet management and procurement practices.

                       City: Cities operating municipal fleets may need to update procurement policies and fleet management practices to align with evolving state requirements for zero-emission vehicles. This may affect operational planning and eligibility for state funding or incentives. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
County: Counties managing fleets for public works and emergency services will likely need to evaluate and transition portions of their fleets to meet updated zero-emission standards, particularly for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Special District: Special Districts that operate service fleets (e.g., for public utilities, transit, or waste management) may face indirect pressure to align with state zero-emission mandates to remain eligible for funding and comply with emerging state standards. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed to manage multi-agency fleets will need to coordinate policy updates and fleet transition strategies among member agencies to ensure consistent compliance with state mandates and reporting requirements. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)

                           The legislative change permits the Department of General Services to use a lease-purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility to replace the DMV field office in San Francisco. With the potential inclusion of mixed-use elements and affordable housing, the bill has indirect local impacts. Local agencies in San Francisco will need to address zoning, permitting, infrastructure, and service coordination issues as state-level property acquisition processes proceed under new legislative notice and Property Acquisition Law requirements.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: The mixed-use development and potential affordable housing integration for the new office facility may require the City to review and adjust local zoning, permitting, and urban planning policies. The City will likely need to engage in regulatory oversight and coordinate with state agencies to ensure local ordinances are met.
County: San Francisco County may be indirectly impacted by changes in infrastructure and service delivery resulting from the state agency&#39;s relocation and property acquisition for a mixed-use development. County agencies may need to reassess budget allocations and service priorities as part of the overall project coordination.

                           The bill expands the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General&#39;s oversight by requiring all contracts and amendments involving high‐speed rail project funds to include specific provisions granting the Inspector General access to records and property. It also extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees and adjusts audit and review responsibilities. Local agencies that may enter into such contracts—whether directly or indirectly as public entities—will need to update their contracting procedures and internal compliance protocols.

                           This legislative change revises the funding allocation for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program. Instead of a fixed 25% for planning and 75% for implementation, eligible entities will now receive up to 25% for planning with the balance going to implementation. Local agencies involved in planning and executing highway-to-boulevard conversions must reassess their project proposals and budgeting strategies to ensure compliance with the new funding guidelines.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities planning or implementing highway conversion projects under the pilot program must adjust their grant proposals and project budgets to align with the new funding split (up to 25% for planning and the remainder for implementation). This may affect how much they can allocate to early-stage planning activities compared to execution costs.
County: Counties participating in or overseeing local infrastructure projects under the pilot program will need to reconfigure planning and implementation budgets, ensuring that planning expenses do not exceed the new maximum of 25% of available funding.
Special District: Special districts engaged in local transportation or related public works projects may be indirectly affected by the change, requiring a review of their funding applications and operational plans to account for the altered balance between planning and implementation funds.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, as defined in the amended statute, are potential eligible entities for the pilot program. They must modify their grant proposals to conform to the revised funding structure, which allows only up to 25% of funds for planning.

                           The legislative change appropriates $100 million from the General Fund to support the Active Transportation Program through the Department of Transportation. Funds will be allocated by the California Transportation Commission until June 30, 2027, with funds available for encumbrance and liquidation until June 30, 2030. Although managed at the state level, this change indirectly impacts local agencies—particularly cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities—that may participate in, or support, active transportation projects through metropolitan planning agencies. These agencies should prepare for new funding opportunities, adjust compliance protocols, and coordinate regional project planning.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities may be eligible to partake in active transportation projects funded under the program. They will need to coordinate with metropolitan planning agencies to apply for these funds, adjust local infrastructure plans, and comply with new reporting and administrative requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
County: Counties could see indirect impacts as active transportation funds support regional infrastructure improvements. They must collaborate with the California Transportation Commission and metropolitan planning agencies to ensure timely applications and effective project implementation. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Special District: Special districts focused on transportation or related infrastructure may qualify to access designated funds. They will need to update administrative processes, submit eligibility information, and ensure compliance with state program parameters. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, which facilitate cooperation among multiple local agencies, could indirectly benefit by organizing collaborative applications for active transportation projects. They must formalize inter-agency agreements and align regional proposals with state deadlines. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)

                           The legislative change expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program by including funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the formula-based component of the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. As a result, regional transportation planning agencies must now submit updated regional short‐term financial plans and transit operator data to qualify for state funds in future fiscal years. Although the change is directed at state-level funding allocations, local agencies—particularly those organized as joint powers authorities, special districts, cities, or counties and involved in regional transportation planning and transit service provision—may be impacted indirectly through new compliance and reporting responsibilities.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       Joint Powers Authority: Regional transportation planning agencies structured as joint powers authorities will be required to update and submit their short‐term financial plans and transit operator data to comply with the expanded accountability program for FY 2025–26, 2026–27, and 2027–28. This change may necessitate adjustments in internal data collection, reporting processes, and interagency coordination.
Special District: Transit agencies operating as special districts may be indirectly affected if they are components of the regional transportation planning process. They will need to ensure that transit operator data and related financial information are accurately provided to their overseeing agencies to secure continued state funding.
City: Cities that are part of regional transportation planning or that manage local transit operations may face indirect impacts due to changes in funding distribution guidelines. They should be prepared to adjust local reporting and compliance mechanisms in case of revised funding criteria or deadlines.
County: Counties involved in regional planning or providing transit services will need to review and update their financial planning and data reporting procedures to meet the new state-imposed submission requirements. This is essential to maintain eligibility for funding under the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program.

                           The legislative change amends the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program by allowing a lead applicant agency to apply for a letter of no prejudice. This letter would let the agency expend its own funds on approved port-related projects with the possibility of future reimbursement if eligible expenditures conditions are met. The measure directly affects the funding and compliance strategies of local agencies involved in administering or operating eligible projects, and it imposes new deadlines since the provision becomes inoperative on 2033-06-30 and is repealed effective 2034-01-01.

                       City: Cities that manage or operate port and freight projects can serve as lead applicant agencies. They must adjust their financial planning and compliance protocols to apply for a letter of no prejudice, enabling them to use their own funds subject to later reimbursement. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
County: Counties responsible for infrastructural projects such as those at port terminals must update their funding and administrative procedures. They need to consider the new option of fronting project costs and secure potential reimbursement, adjusting internal budgeting and compliance measures. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Special District: Special Districts that handle specific services including transportation and port improvements will need to evaluate their role as lead applicant agencies. They must integrate new funding strategies and ensure that all reimbursement criteria and administrative requirements are met. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, formed by cooperative agreements between public agencies, will have to coordinate among their members to decide on applying as the lead applicant. They must align their joint funding strategies and administrative oversight to comply with the new reimbursement mechanism. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)

While this is a state financing adjustment, local agencies may be indirectly affected through enhanced coordination, permitting adjustments, and infrastructure planning requirements as state agencies manage a larger administrative apparatus.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities along the projected high-speed rail corridors may need to update local zoning, permitting, and infrastructure planning processes to coordinate with the state’s expanded administrative oversight.
County: Counties could face changes in permitting, environmental review, and infrastructure planning requirements due to increased administrative funds at the state level, necessitating alignment with statewide high-speed rail initiatives.
Special District: Special districts, especially those involved in transportation or local infrastructure, may need to adapt budgeting and operational practices as state administrative provisions expand, affecting local service delivery.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that involve multiple local entities might have to revise interagency agreements and shared regulatory compliance protocols to accommodate the changes in state-level administrative funding and oversight.
