                       This legislative change directs state transportation leadership to review and reallocate state funds for grade separation projects that have lost prior funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. The Secretary of Transportation is required to coordinate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission and report on the funding situation by April 30, 2025. There is no direct imposition or compliance requirement on local public agencies.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program by incorporating funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund into the formula-based portion of the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. It requires regional transportation planning agencies to update and submit their short‐term financial plans and transit operator data for the 2025–26 fiscal year (with additional data submissions for 2026–27 and 2027–28) and authorizes the Transportation Agency to revise fund distribution guidelines by specified dates. This change does not directly impact any local public agencies as defined by the provided list.

                       The legislative change allows lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice. This letter permits an agency to expend its own funds on port-specific projects with the prospect of later reimbursement if eligibility conditions are met. The mechanism is available only until it becomes inoperative on 2033-06-30 and is fully repealed on 2034-01-01, so affected agencies must adjust their funding strategies accordingly.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change modifies state fleet requirements by mandating that the Department of Transportation compile and submit an annual report—with analysis of vehicle duty performance and details on charging/refueling infrastructure—on zero‐emission vehicles acquired by the department. The change continues existing state fleet purchasing targets but does not impose new or direct operational obligations on local public agencies such as cities, counties, or school districts.

                       The legislative change authorizes the Department of General Services to enter into a lease-purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build‐to‐suit office facility to replace the DMV field office in San Francisco. The new facility may be developed as a mixed‐use project incorporating affordable housing. The lease will require Department of Finance approval, adherence to legislative notice requirements, and compliance with the Property Acquisition Law. This is a state-level real property transaction without direct operational requirements imposed on local public agencies.

                       The bill revises and expands the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General’s responsibilities by requiring audits of contract compliance, extending whistleblower protections to contractor employees, and mandating that all contracts using high-speed rail project funds (on or after July 1, 2024) include specific access provisions. These changes affect the operations and oversight practices related to high-speed rail funding but do not directly impact any of the specified local public agency types.

                       The legislative change adjusts the funding allocation in the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program. Previously, 25% of available funds were reserved for planning and 75% for implementation; now, up to 25% may be allocated for planning with the remainder reserved for implementation. This change alters the program’s funding structure without imposing new statutory or compliance requirements on local public agencies.
