                           This bill revises the Higher Education Student Housing Grant Program by modifying the submission requirements for student housing project applications, adding a new measure to the composite score used to rank applications, increasing appropriations by $6,000,000 for CSU Humboldt, and repealing a separate $3,893,000 appropriation. Although the program targets higher education institutions, the changes may indirectly affect local agencies involved in permitting, zoning, infrastructure planning, and service provision for new or renovated student housing developments.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities could see an increase or change in student housing projects prompting a review and potential update of local zoning laws and permitting processes. Local government planning departments may need to adapt to revised timelines or project criteria driven by the state’s updated grant application process.
County: Counties may experience changes in infrastructure planning and regional permitting as new student housing projects emerge or existing projects are modified based on the revised application and funding guidelines.
Special District: Special Districts that manage utilities and transit services may face shifts in demand if a surge in student housing construction affects local service usage, necessitating a review of capacity and coordination with municipal planning.
Community College: Although community colleges typically serve commuter populations, changes in state policy regarding student housing could trigger future planning discussions or opportunities for off‐campus housing initiatives, requiring monitoring of state guidance.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, formed for coordinated regional planning, may need to adjust inter-agency agreements and collaborative efforts if changes in the grant program alter the scope or timeline for student housing projects in the region.

                           The bill amends Education Code Section 88280 governing the Classified Community College Employee Summer Assistance Program. It redefines &#39;month&#39; as 20 days or 4 weeks of 5 days each (including legal holidays), which impacts how participating community colleges calculate payroll deductions and summer benefit payouts. Community colleges must update their systems and policies to ensure compliance with this statutory change.

                           The California Student Housing Revolving Loan Fund Act of 2022 creates a new state-level loan program providing zero‐interest financing for constructing affordable student housing and affordable faculty/staff housing at UC, CSU, and California Community Colleges. Directly, eligible Community Colleges can tap these funds, while indirectly cities, counties, and special districts may experience increased housing development activity needing adjustments in zoning, permitting, and service delivery. The act also requires a state report by March 15, 2025, to assess program performance.

                       Community College: Eligible California Community Colleges can secure zero‐interest loans to finance construction or refinancing of affordable housing projects, requiring compliance with state eligibility criteria and project standards.
City: Cities hosting higher education institutions may experience increased affordable housing developments, which could require adjustments to zoning codes and permitting processes to facilitate these projects.
County: Counties in areas with major higher education institutions might see a surge in new affordable housing projects, leading to necessary updates in local planning and permitting frameworks.
Special District: Special Districts responsible for services such as utilities and transit may need to assess their capacity and adjust service delivery to accommodate potential infrastructure demands from new housing projects.

                           The bill amends Cal Grant eligibility rules by authorizing, for the 2023–24 academic year only, an appeal option for a qualifying institution that failed to meet the 3-year cohort default rate if the shortfall was caused by the acquisition of an out-of-state institution that closed between the 2019–20 and 2022–23 academic years. This change affects locally governed higher education providers by altering compliance requirements for maintaining grant eligibility.

                           The bill revises the NextUp program eligibility for foster youth attending California Community Colleges by changing the age requirement to be assessed only at the student&#39;s initial enrollment academic year and by removing the income waiver condition.

                           The bill amends the Middle Class Scholarship Program by establishing a minimum annual scholarship award of $90 for all eligible full-time students, effective with the 2022–23 academic year. Although the primary institutions are state-level (University of California and California State University), community colleges offering baccalaureate programs are indirectly impacted. These local agencies must update their scholarship administration systems, compliance procedures, and student communications to accommodate the new minimum award requirement.

                           The legislative change revises the administration of the AANHPI Student Achievement Program at California Community Colleges and California State University by shifting key responsibilities to the applicable statewide central office. In particular, the office now must develop new grant criteria and a process for funding, establish an AANHPI stakeholder process, and prepare annual reports. Although the law directly targets state-level offices and campuses in the two systems, Community Colleges—as local public agencies—will be indirectly impacted through changes to funding allocations and increased compliance and reporting obligations.

                       Community College: Community Colleges that qualify for the AANHPI Student Achievement Program must now adhere to new grant program criteria and processes developed by the statewide central office. They are also expected to support the new stakeholder process and ensure that data required for both an annual report (due on or before March 31 each year) and a final independent evaluator’s report (due March 31, 2026) is properly collected and submitted. These changes could affect their funding levels and administrative procedures. (Deadline: March 31, 2026)
