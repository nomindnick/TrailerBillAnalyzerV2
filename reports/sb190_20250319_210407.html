                       This bill expands the Part-time Community College Faculty Health Insurance Program to include multidistrict part-time faculty, allowing them to receive health insurance benefits if their teaching assignments across multiple districts meet certain criteria. Community college districts are affected as they must now offer health insurance to these faculty members and reimburse them for a proportionate share of their health insurance premiums. The impact includes administrative adjustments to accommodate the new eligibility and reimbursement requirements.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill allows the Student Aid Commission to grant an appeal for the 2023–24 academic year to institutions that failed to meet the 3-year cohort default rate due to acquiring an out-of-state institution that impacted their rate, provided the acquired institution closed between the 2019–20 and 2022–23 academic years. This change affects qualifying postsecondary institutions, as it provides a temporary exception to maintain eligibility for Cal Grant awards, impacting their ability to offer financial aid to students.

                       This bill modifies the eligibility criteria for the NextUp program, which supports postsecondary education for foster youth, by changing the age requirement to be no older than 25 at the time of first enrollment rather than at the start of any academic year. It also removes additional eligibility requirements for foster youth who meet specified criteria and eliminates the waiver of income criteria as a condition of eligibility. This change affects community college districts as they administer the NextUp program and must adjust their enrollment processes and eligibility criteria accordingly.

The affected local public agencies are the California State University and California Community Colleges, as they must implement these changes to enhance support for AANHPI students. These agencies are impacted by needing to adjust their funding allocation processes, engage stakeholders, and produce detailed annual reports and evaluations.
