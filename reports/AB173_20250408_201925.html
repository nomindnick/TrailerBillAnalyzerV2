                           The bill expands the criteria that law enforcement agencies must satisfy to request an Ebony Alert by requiring that all available local resources have been used and that sufficient actionable information exists to aid in the safe recovery of missing Black youth. Although the changes target law enforcement procedures and activation protocols by the California Highway Patrol, they indirectly impact local public agencies—specifically those with law enforcement functions housed within City and County governments, as well as collaborative arrangements like Joint Powers Authorities. These agencies will need to update their procedures, enhance interagency coordination, and ensure proper documentation to comply with the revised requirements.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: City law enforcement units (such as municipal police departments) must update their investigative protocols to incorporate the expanded determination criteria for requesting an Ebony Alert, ensuring that all available local resources are utilized and that information critical to the recovery efforts is documented.
County: County law enforcement agencies (like sheriff&#39;s departments) are required to modify their investigative procedures to reflect the new criteria. This includes ensuring full use of local resources and improving coordination with other local entities, which may involve joint reporting or data sharing arrangements.
Joint Powers Authority: Entities formed by local agencies through joint powers arrangements may be indirectly impacted by the need to revise and streamline collaborative protocols. They will have to ensure that the collective use of local resources is maximized and documented when responding to missing persons cases.

                           This legislative change directs state transportation leadership to coordinate with key state agencies and reallocate available transportation funds to support grade separation projects that risk losing local and federal funding or falling behind schedule. Although the bill targets state agency roles, it indirectly impacts local agencies involved in funding and implementing grade separation and related transportation infrastructure projects.

                       City: Cities that have contributed local funding or are engaged in local grade separation projects may need to adjust budgets and coordinate with state agencies to align with the reallocated funding and updated project priorities.
County: Counties involved in local infrastructure and road projects may encounter shifts in funding obligations and project management as state funds are redirected to stabilize grade separation projects.
Special District: Special districts responsible for local services, including transportation and related infrastructure, might need to adjust project plans and budgetary allocations based on state reallocation measures addressing funding gaps.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that manage multi-jurisdictional transportation projects may have to realign local funding pledges and synchronize project management efforts with state-led funding reallocation initiatives.

                           The bill expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program to cover funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund under the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. This means that regional transportation planning agencies—often organized as Joint Powers Authorities or Special Districts and potentially involving cities and counties—must update their regional short‐term financial plans and transit operator data to remain eligible for state funding starting in fiscal year 2025–26 and continuing through 2027–28. Affected local agencies will need to adjust compliance processes, monitor modified deadlines and guidelines, and coordinate closely with state authorities to ensure continued access to these funds.

Special District: If a regional transportation planning agency is organized as a Special District, it will be required to comply with the new reporting guidelines to secure ongoing funding.
County: Counties that either host regional transportation planning functions or operate transit services may be indirectly affected by changes in reporting requirements and funding guidelines.
City: Cities participating in regional transit planning or operating municipal transit systems should coordinate with regional bodies to ensure compliance with updated reporting and funding requirements.

                           The legislative change sets state-mandated targets and reporting requirements for transitioning government fleets to zero‐emission vehicles. While the law directly imposes procurement and reporting obligations on state agencies (Department of General Services and Department of Transportation), it indirectly impacts local agencies by establishing standards that may influence local fleet policies, funding, and infrastructure investments. Cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities operating medium‐ and heavy‐duty vehicles should anticipate pressure to align procurement practices and develop charging/refueling infrastructure consistent with state-level expectations.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities managing municipal fleets, including medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, might face indirect pressure to update procurement guidelines and infrastructure plans in order to qualify for state funding or to align with emerging zero-emission standards. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
County: Counties operating public works and government fleets may need to revise acquisition strategies and budgeting processes to meet state-driven zero-emission targets, especially if state funding provisions or incentive programs become linked to compliance. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Special District: Special districts that provide specific local services and operate fleets may be indirectly affected if state environmental mandates and funding incentives require the adoption of zero-emission vehicles and related performance reporting. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, which coordinate among multiple local agencies, may need to harmonize fleet policies and oversee collective compliance initiatives as state mandates push for standardized zero-emission vehicle integration across jurisdictions. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)

                           The legislative change authorizes the Department of General Services, with the consent of the Department of Motor Vehicles, to enter into a lease‐purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility that replaces the DMV field office in San Francisco. The project, which may be developed as a mixed-use facility incorporating affordable housing, is subject to approval by the Department of Finance and must comply with legislative notice requirements and the Property Acquisition Law. While the change is directed at state agency operations, local public agencies in San Francisco may be indirectly impacted through adjustments in local zoning, planning, permitting processes, and oversight coordination.

                       City: The City of San Francisco may need to update or adapt local zoning and permitting practices to accommodate a mixed-use development that integrates affordable housing alongside office space. Coordination with state agencies will be required to meet legislative notice and Property Acquisition Law compliance requirements.
County: San Francisco County, which functions as part of the consolidated city-county government, could experience indirect impacts through adjustments in land use oversight, infrastructure planning, and potential budgetary shifts related to accommodating new development parameters imposed by the project.

                           The legislative change revises the funding allocation for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program. Instead of a fixed 25% set-aside for planning and 75% for implementation, the new provision requires that up to 25% of available funding can be allocated for planning, with the remainder designated for implementation. This change could alter the budgeting, proposal structuring, and compliance processes for local agencies participating in or affected by the program.

                       Joint Powers Authority: The amendment includes a definition for &#39;Joint Powers Authority&#39;, enabling such entities to participate in the competitive grant program. Agencies structured as joint powers authorities must review eligibility criteria and adjust their collaborative grant applications to meet the revised funding allocation.
City: Cities applying for pilot program grants will need to adjust their proposal budgets and planning strategies under the new rule, which caps planning funds at up to 25% of available funding. This may require re-evaluating project scopes and budgeting assumptions.
County: Counties involved in transportation or infrastructure projects may face a shift in the allocation of funds between planning and implementation. They must re-examine their project budgets and funding applications to ensure compliance with the revised statutory guidelines.
Special District: Special districts that are eligible to apply for the pilot program must update their project proposals and planning documents to align with the new funding structure, ensuring that the planning phase does not exceed up to 25% of total available funds.

                           The legislative change increases the cap on administrative expenditures from 2.5% to 5% of the net proceeds from high-speed rail bonds. While the adjustment is directed at state-level funding for planning, engineering, and administrative operations for high-speed rail, local agencies involved in regional infrastructure and transportation planning may face indirect impacts. These impacts include the need to coordinate budgets, adjust planning processes, and revise intergovernmental agreements as state appropriations and funding formulas shift.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that participate in regional transportation planning may need to reexamine local permits, zoning, and infrastructure coordination in response to altered state budgeting priorities for high-speed rail administration.
County: Counties involved in regional infrastructure projects may see changes in funding formulas and administrative oversight that affect local transportation and public works planning.
Special District: Special districts that manage transit or related services could need to adapt project coordination and contractual terms if state-level shifts in bond fund allocation influence local infrastructure projects.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by local agencies may have to update their collaborative planning and governance structures to align with revised administrative funding processes driven by the state’s change.

                           The bill appropriates $100,000,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation to support the Active Transportation Program. While the primary change is state level, the funding flow and program requirements will indirectly impact local agencies, such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities. These entities may need to align project planning, funding applications, and compliance processes with the new state deadlines and guidelines to access active transportation funds.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       
                           This legislative change expands the oversight role of the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General by imposing a new duty to review and investigate compliance with contract provisions for any public or private entity that receives high-speed rail project funds. It also extends whistleblower protections to employees of rail contractors and mandates that all contracts (or contract amendments) executed on or after July 1, 2024, include specific provisions granting the Inspector General access to relevant records and property. While the primary focus is on state-level rail oversight, local agencies that engage in contracts for rail-related services or infrastructure development may be indirectly affected.

                       City: Cities that contract with the High-Speed Rail Authority or receive high-speed rail project funds must include mandated Inspector General clauses in contracts. This exposes them to potential audits and compliance reviews regarding contract adherence. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
County: Counties engaged in projects or contracts funded by the high-speed rail initiative must incorporate the new contractual provisions, making them subject to oversight and review for compliance. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
Special District: Special Districts that receive or utilize high-speed rail project funds are indirectly impacted, as their contracts must now include provisions for inspector general access and may be subject to enhanced oversight. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities involved in multi-agency projects related to high-speed rail funding must ensure all contractual agreements comply with the new statutory obligation, potentially leading to increased scrutiny through state audits. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)

                           The bill amends the Streets and Highways Code to allow lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice, which permits them to use their own funds to advance port-related projects and then seek reimbursement from state program funds if eligibility conditions are met. This change introduces new financial and compliance responsibilities for agencies that serve as project administrators, indirectly impacting several types of local agencies involved in the planning, execution, and management of port and freight infrastructure projects. Agencies must adjust internal processes, meet stricter funding controls, and act before the statutory deadlines.

                       City: Cities acting as lead applicant agencies on port projects can now expend local funds based on a no-prejudice letter and later obtain reimbursement. This requires updating budgeting procedures, internal controls, and compliance processes to meet state guidelines. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
County: Counties administering or operating eligible port-related projects must adjust their financial management and project planning to capitalize on the new pre-financing mechanism, ensuring that expenditures qualify for future state reimbursement. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Special District: Special districts involved in port and freight infrastructure, such as port authorities structured as special districts, are affected by the ability to pre-finance projects. They must establish internal approval workflows and adhere to state-imposed conditions to secure later reimbursement. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, when acting as lead applicant agencies in collaborative port projects, must coordinate inter-agency efforts to apply for and secure the no-prejudice letter, ensuring that all members comply with the new reimbursement conditions and regulatory requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
