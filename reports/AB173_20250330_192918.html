                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change directs the Secretary of Transportation to work with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify state funds for grade separation projects that risk losing local or federal financial commitments or falling behind schedule. Although the changes are implemented at the state level, they indirectly impact local agencies involved in transportation infrastructure by altering funding dynamics, coordination requirements, and project planning expectations.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that participate in or contribute to grade separation projects may see shifts in their local funding roles as the state agency reallocates funds to cover projects at risk. This may require cities to review their budget commitments, update local funding arrangements, and actively coordinate with state transportation officials. (Deadline: April 30, 2025)
County: County governments that support transportation infrastructure projects are likely to need reassessment of their local funding contributions given the state’s new authority in directly allocating funds. This requires counties to reexamine project priorities and potentially update inter-agency funding agreements. (Deadline: April 30, 2025)
Special District: Transportation-related Special Districts could be indirectly affected as their funding participation might change with the reallocation of state funds. These districts should re-evaluate their agreements and financial commitments to grade separation projects.
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs formed by local agencies to jointly manage transportation projects may face changes to their funding mixes and collaboration frameworks. They should review joint funding arrangements as the state directly allocates funds for projects at risk.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The bill expands the scope of the Transportation Agency’s accountability program to include funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund under the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. It requires regional transportation planning agencies to update their regional short‐term financial plans and transit operator data in order to access funding for the 2025–26 fiscal year and beyond. Although the changes are directed at state-level procedures, local agencies involved in transit operations—such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities—face indirect impacts. These agencies may need to adjust data reporting, financial planning, and compliance procedures to conform with the updated guidelines and evolving funding formulas.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that operate or partner in local transit systems may be required to assist in updating transit operator data and adjust local budgeting practices to align with new reporting guidelines. This change could affect how cities receive or contribute to regional funding under the modified accountability program.
County: Counties, which may play a role as operators or partners in regional transit projects, will need to adhere to revised financial and data submission requirements. These changes may lead to adjustments in local financial planning to secure transit funding.
Special District: Transit agencies structured as special districts will be directly impacted by the new data submission and guideline modification requirements. Compliance with these changes is necessary to continue receiving allocations from the expanded funding sources.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that coordinate transit initiatives across multiple local entities must adapt to the new reporting requirements. This includes gathering and submitting coordinated transit operator data as part of updated regional financial reporting.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change advances California’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gases by mandating a shift to zero‐emission vehicles for government fleets. Although many requirements target state agencies (e.g., minimum percentages for heavy- and light-duty vehicles and an annual reporting requirement by the Department of Transportation), the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation also applies to local government fleets. This means that cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities that operate medium- and heavy-duty trucks or other high-priority fleets must prepare to update their procurement policies, fleet management practices, and potentially their infrastructure (e.g., EV charging/refueling stations) in order to align with state mandates and guidelines.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities with fleets that include medium- and heavy-duty trucks may need to revise procurement processes and operational policies to align with state mandates on zero-emission vehicle acquisition. This may also involve planning for necessary infrastructure improvements and ensuring coordination with state reporting mechanisms. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
County: County agencies that manage fleets with medium- and heavy-duty trucks must begin planning for a transition to zero-emission vehicles. This includes reassessing vehicle replacement schedules, updating procurement guidelines, and aligning internal policies with emerging state-level mandates. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Special District: Special districts that operate fleets—such as those for public transit, water, or sanitation—may be indirectly affected by the state&#39;s zero-emission mandates. They will need to assess their fleet composition, update procurement processes, and plan for upgrades to supporting infrastructure. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities coordinating services across multiple local entities may also have fleets that fall under the new mandates. They will need to harmonize policies among member agencies, update fleet management practices, and possibly institute reporting mechanisms consistent with state requirements. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislative change expands the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General’s oversight by requiring that all contracts (and amendments) using high-speed rail project funds include specific provisions granting the Inspector General unfettered access to records and property. It also extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees and revises budget notification requirements. While the primary focus is state-level infrastructure oversight, the changes indirectly affect local public agencies that may be involved as contractors or partners in high-speed rail projects.

                       This legislative change adjusts the funding allocation requirements for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by replacing a fixed 25% planning/75% implementation split with a flexible standard that requires up to 25% of available funding to be allocated for planning and the remainder for implementation. This change, though primarily state-level, may indirectly impact local agencies involved in infrastructure projects by affecting how they budget, plan, and submit grant proposals under the program.

                       City: Cities that apply for competitive grants under the program must adjust project budgets and planning documents to accommodate the new flexible funding allocation, ensuring proposals comply with updated state guidelines.
County: Counties responsible for local infrastructure and transportation improvements will be required to re-evaluate budgeting processes and adjust financial plans to conform to the variable planning funding allocation.
Special District: Special Districts engaged in transportation or infrastructure projects might need to update cost estimates and planning documentation to align with the new funding split, impacting project scheduling and implementation plans.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, which coordinate efforts among multiple local agencies, must synchronize budgeting and grant applications across partner entities in response to the change in funding allocation.

                       The legislative change modifies the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program by authorizing a lead applicant agency to apply for a letter of no prejudice. This letter, once approved by the Secretary of Transportation, will allow an agency to expend its own funds on port-specific projects (or components thereof) with the prospect of future reimbursement for eligible expenditures if certain conditions are met. The change impacts local public agencies that act as lead applicants in port/freight projects by altering funding and reimbursement mechanisms. Note that these provisions are temporary – they become inoperative on 2033-06-30 and are repealed on 2034-01-01.

This change allows for self-financing with later reimbursement, subject to stringent reporting and compliance standards. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Special District: Special Districts, including port authorities, may serve as lead applicant agencies under the program. They now have the option to utilize their own funds for approved projects if they obtain a letter of no prejudice, which mandates adherence to reimbursement conditions and proper financial oversight.

Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by collaborative local agencies can act as lead applicants for port-related infrastructure projects. They are now empowered to use their own funds upfront by applying for a letter of no prejudice, ensuring coordinated self-financing with eventual reimbursement if conditions are met.

                       The bill appropriates $100,000,000 from the General Fund to support the state’s Active Transportation Program. Funds will be allocated by the California Transportation Commission with key deadlines for allocation and fund liquidation. This change can directly and indirectly affect local agencies by creating new funding opportunities, compliance requirements, and coordination responsibilities for the implementation of projects that improve biking and walking infrastructure.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities may receive or partner on active transportation projects funded through the state allocation. They must coordinate with metropolitan planning agencies and follow state guidelines in order to qualify for and administer project funds for infrastructure improvements such as bike lanes and pedestrian walkways. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
County: Counties, as key participants in regional transportation planning, may become involved in allocating or managing these funds. They will need to align local transportation projects with state program requirements and coordinate with metropolitan planning agencies. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Special District: Special districts handling transportation or related infrastructure services may be eligible for funding under the active transportation program. They must review eligibility requirements and prepare project proposals that comply with state standards. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities involved in metropolitan planning may be tasked with managing or distributing allocated funds. They will need to ensure inter-agency coordination and compliance with state funding guidelines. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
School District: Although not the primary target, school districts could be indirectly affected if projects include improvements related to safe routes or pedestrian safety around schools. Local educational agencies may need to coordinate with city or county officials to align with broader active transportation initiatives.

                       This legislative change permits the Department of General Services, with DMV consent, to enter a lease-purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility to replace the DMV field office in San Francisco. The project may incorporate a mixed-use element—including affordable housing—and must obtain Department of Finance approval, follow legislative notice procedures, and comply with the Property Acquisition Law. Although the change is state‐driven, local agencies in San Francisco (both City and County) may be indirectly impacted through planning, zoning, and regulatory oversight responsibilities.

                       City: The City of San Francisco will need to engage in zoning reviews, planning coordination, and compliance checks related to the mixed-use development aspects of the project, especially if affordable housing is integrated.
County: Since San Francisco is a consolidated City and County, the county element must also oversee the regional planning implications and maintain alignment with local regulations as the state project unfolds.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change increases the allowable percentage of high‐speed rail bond proceeds that can be used for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5%. While the change is directed at a state funding mechanism for the high-speed rail project, it may indirectly affect local agencies involved in regional transportation planning, permitting, and interagency coordination. Affected local agencies should monitor state Budget Act appropriations and adjust their coordination and compliance processes accordingly.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities along the high‐speed rail corridors may experience changes in local permit reviews, planning processes, and intergovernmental coordination as state-level administrative funding increases, potentially affecting local infrastructure projects and development timelines.
County: Counties could be impacted by shifts in how state funds are allocated between capital projects and administrative costs, affecting regional infrastructure planning, local oversight, and coordination with state agencies on transportation projects.
Special District: Special districts, especially those involved with transit or other transportation services, may need to reassess interagency agreements and funding responsibilities as the state reallocates funds towards administrative functions in the high-speed rail project.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed to manage regional transportation initiatives might face changes in funding distribution and administrative oversight, requiring a reevaluation of joint funding commitments and project coordination processes.
