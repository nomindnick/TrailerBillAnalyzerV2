                           This bill amends the Ebony Alert system for missing Black youth by expanding the criteria law enforcement agencies must meet to request an alert, making CHP activation mandatory when criteria are met, and requiring CHP to submit a report by July 1, 2027. This directly impacts local law enforcement agencies operated by cities and counties.

                           This legislation requires the Secretary of Transportation to identify alternative funding for grade separation projects that lost previously awarded funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. The Transportation Agency is authorized to prioritize and directly allocate funds to projects at risk of losing federal/local funding commitments or facing schedule delays. Local agencies that had grade separation projects with reverted funding may have an opportunity to secure replacement funding.

                           This bill authorizes the Department of General Services to enter into a lease-purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility to replace the DMV field office in San Francisco.

                           This legislative change expands the powers of the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General to review contract compliance of entities receiving high-speed rail project funds, extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees, and requires specific contract provisions granting the inspector general access to records beginning July 1, 2024. This primarily affects local agencies that receive high-speed rail project funds or contract with the High-Speed Rail Authority.

                           The legislative change modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation from a fixed &#39;25% for planning and 75% for implementation&#39; to &#39;up to 25% for planning and the remainder for implementation.&#39; This creates greater flexibility in funding allocation, potentially allowing more money to flow to implementation projects if planning needs less than 25% of available funding.

                       City: Cities that partner with Caltrans on highway conversion projects will see increased flexibility in how program funds are allocated. Cities with implementation-ready projects may benefit from potentially increased implementation funding if less than 25% is allocated to planning.
County: Counties that partner with Caltrans on highway conversion projects will experience more flexibility in program funding allocation. Counties with implementation-ready projects may see increased implementation funding if planning requires less than 25% of available funds.
Special District: Transportation-related special districts (such as transit or transportation districts) that are eligible to partner with Caltrans will experience a more flexible funding allocation system, potentially favoring implementation-ready projects.
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs focused on transportation or regional planning that partner with Caltrans may benefit from the increased flexibility in funding allocation, particularly if they have implementation-ready highway conversion projects.

                           This bill amends the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to authorize lead applicant agencies to apply for a &#39;letter of no prejudice&#39; allowing them to use their own funds for approved port infrastructure projects with the possibility of future reimbursement from program moneys if certain conditions are met. This creates a new financing option for local agencies involved in port and freight infrastructure projects.

                           This legislative change increases the percentage of bond proceeds from the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act that can be used for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5%. While primarily affecting the state-level California High-Speed Rail Authority, this change has indirect impacts on local agencies located along the high-speed rail corridor.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities along the high-speed rail corridor may experience indirect impacts as more bond funds will be allocated to administrative purposes, potentially reducing available funding for actual project implementation in their jurisdictions. This could affect collaborative projects, station area planning, and local infrastructure connections to high-speed rail stations.
County: Counties along the high-speed rail route may experience indirect impacts as the reallocation of bond proceeds could affect funding available for implementation of high-speed rail projects within their boundaries. This may impact county transportation planning and infrastructure coordination efforts.
Special District: Transportation-related special districts that interface with high-speed rail planning may be indirectly affected if they are recipients of or partners in high-speed rail funding. The increased administrative allocation could result in fewer funds available for actual project implementation.
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs formed for regional transportation planning or high-speed rail implementation may experience indirect impacts if the reallocation of bond proceeds affects their collaborative projects with the California High-Speed Rail Authority.

                           This bill appropriates $100 million from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation for the Active Transportation Program, with funds to be allocated by the California Transportation Commission until June 30, 2027, and available for encumbrance and liquidation until June 30, 2030. This creates additional funding opportunities for local agencies to implement active transportation projects that encourage biking, walking, and other non-motorized transportation.

                           This bill requires the California Department of Transportation (a state agency) to annually report to the Legislature on its zero-emission vehicles and charging infrastructure. While the bill itself does not create new requirements for local agencies, the information produced in these reports could indirectly benefit local agencies that must comply with the existing Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation by providing valuable data on zero-emission vehicle performance, costs, and infrastructure needs.
