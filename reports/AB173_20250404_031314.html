                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change requires the Secretary of Transportation to work with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and reallocate available state transportation funds toward grade separation projects. While the measure primarily targets state-level funding and project management, local agencies may be indirectly affected because many such projects involve local funding commitments and collaborative planning. Cities, Counties, Special Districts, and Joint Powers Authorities may need to adjust project timelines, reassess local funding arrangements, and enhance coordination with state agencies.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities with grade separation projects may have to reexamine local funding contributions and adjust project timelines if state funds are reallocated to cover shortfalls. They will also need to coordinate with state transportation agencies to align local project requirements with the new funding priorities.
County: Counties involved in local transportation initiatives could see changes in funding arrangements as the state reassigns resources to cover grade separation projects at risk. They should reassess local funding structures and adjust project implementation timelines in line with state priorities.
Special District: Transportation-related special districts may be impacted by the reallocation of state funds, which could affect the scheduling and operation of local projects. They will need to comply with new funding allocation procedures and possibly revise their project planning to align with state priorities.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities managing multi-agency transportation projects may face indirect impacts due to changes in state funding allocations. Enhanced inter-agency collaboration and an adjustment of project timelines may be necessary to secure and integrate allocated funds.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change revises the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act by increasing the cap on administrative use of bond proceeds from 2.5% to 5%. Although the amendment is primarily state-directed toward high-speed rail planning and capital projects, it may indirectly affect local agencies that participate in or coordinate with these initiatives. Local governments and collaborative entities may need to adjust their oversight, reporting, and coordination practices to align with revised funding allocations and state compliance requirements.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that oversee local infrastructure and transit coordination may be affected by changed administrative fund flows. They should review and possibly adjust local reporting and coordination practices as state-level procedures are updated to reflect the increased administrative cap.
County: Counties involved in regional planning and transit oversight could face new dynamics in funding and compliance as more funds become available for administration, affecting local coordination with state rail planning efforts.
Special District: Special districts, especially those related to transit or transportation services, may need to adjust planning and operational practices in response to shifting administrative funding procedures and potential changes in how state funds are allocated locally.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that coordinate multi-agency infrastructure projects may be affected by revised administrative spending processes. They should reevaluate their agreements and reporting structures to ensure smooth integration with state-level high-speed rail project management.

                       The legislative change expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program to now cover funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund used in the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. Regional transportation planning agencies must provide an updated regional short-term financial plan and updated transit operator data in order to access funds in future fiscal years (FY 2025–26, FY 2026–27, and FY 2027–28). This change indirectly impacts local public agencies that participate in or structure themselves as regional transportation planning entities.

                       Joint Powers Authority: Regional transportation planning agencies organized as Joint Powers Authorities must now submit updated short-term financial plans and transit operator data to qualify for funds. This requires enhanced internal data collection and coordination among the member agencies.
Special District: Transit authorities or regional planning agencies operating as Special Districts will be required to comply with the expanded accountability program by updating their financial plans and transit operator data in order to receive funding.
City: Cities that either directly operate transit services or participate in regional transportation planning may be required to coordinate the submission of transit operator data and align local financial reporting with the new guidelines.
County: Counties involved in regional transportation planning or operating county-level transit services must ensure that their agencies are coordinated to meet the new reporting requirements for updated financial plans and transit operator data.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change mandates that government fleets, including local ones, transition to zero‐emission vehicles. While the primary requirements apply to state entities, the regulation explicitly covers local, state, and federal fleets. Consequently, local agencies that operate fleets—such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities—will need to review and adjust their vehicle procurement practices, fleet replacement strategies, and related infrastructure (e.g., charging and refueling stations). In addition, educational agencies like school districts and county offices of education may be indirectly affected if state funding or program guidelines extend to their transportation fleets.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that manage municipal fleets—including medium- and heavy-duty trucks—must update procurement policies and infrastructure planning to meet the zero-emission mandate. This may require revising vehicle acquisition processes, planning for fleet replacement, and establishing the necessary charging/refueling infrastructure. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
County: Counties with local government fleets need to align their vehicle procurement and maintenance procedures with new state mandates. This includes transitioning to zero-emission vehicles, which may also involve coordination to secure funding and update infrastructure. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Special District: Special districts operating their own fleets must evaluate current vehicle inventories and modify future procurement processes to comply with the new zero-emission standards. This change may also necessitate additional investments in vehicle-related infrastructure. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that oversee shared fleet services across multiple local agencies must collaborate to implement a unified strategy for transitioning to zero-emission vehicles. Coordination among member agencies will be essential for timely compliance. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
School District: School districts operating transportation fleets (such as school buses) may experience indirect impacts if state policies or funding programs expand zero-emission requirements to educational fleets. These agencies should monitor state policy developments and assess potential implications.
County Office of Education: County offices of education could be indirectly affected if state fleet transition mandates and related funding guidelines extend to vehicles used for educational purposes. They should anticipate potential changes in regional procurement practices.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The bill amends Public Utilities Code provisions governing the High-Speed Rail Authority by expanding the Inspector General’s oversight responsibilities. It now requires review of contract adherence for any public or private entity that receives high-speed rail project funds and extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees. While these changes target state-level oversight, they indirectly impact local public agencies that may contract with, or collaborate on, high-speed rail projects. In particular, cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities must update their contracting processes and internal policies to comply with the new requirements, especially for contracts executed on or after July 1, 2024.

                       City: Cities entering contracts to receive high-speed rail project funds must include provisions that grant the Inspector General access to records and property. They need to review existing agreements and amend future contracts to ensure compliance with the new oversight requirements. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
County: Counties partnering with the High-Speed Rail Authority for project funding will face enhanced oversight. They must ensure that contract provisions allow IG access to key records and implement internal monitoring protocols for compliance. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
Special District: Special Districts that receive high-speed rail project funds are required to update their contract templates to incorporate the specified provisions that allow IG access and facilitate periodic reviews and audits. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by multiple local agencies for rail projects must integrate the mandated contract provisions across all joint agreements. This ensures that all member agencies are subject to the extended oversight and compliance responsibilities. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)

                       The legislative change revises the funding allocation for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program. Previously, the program mandated that 25% of available funds be designated for planning and 75% for implementation. Under the new bill, agencies applying for these funds must now allocate up to 25% for planning with the remainder for implementation. This change, while adjusting funding proportions, impacts local agencies involved in transportation and infrastructure projects managed through competitive grant processes by necessitating revisions in budget planning and compliance protocols.

County: Counties engaged in transportation or infrastructure projects will need to update their funding strategies and internal controls to meet the new allocation criteria, ensuring continued eligibility for competitive grants.
Special District: Special districts, particularly those related to transportation or infrastructure services, must adjust their project funding structures to align with the revised balance between planning and implementation funds.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, explicitly mentioned in the revised definitions, should realign their collaborative projects and funding proposals to incorporate the revised funding split, ensuring that planning costs do not exceed the permitted limit.

                       The legislative change revises the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program by allowing a lead applicant agency to apply for a letter of no prejudice that permits the agency to expend its own funds on port-related projects with a promise of later reimbursement from state program monies if certain conditions are met. This change impacts local agencies that participate in, administer, or partner on eligible port projects and introduces new funding mechanisms and compliance requirements. The provisions will expire on June 30, 2033, and be repealed as of January 1, 2034.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: City agencies serving as lead applicant entities under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program may now apply for a letter of no prejudice, allowing them to use local funds upfront for port projects provided all eligible conditions for reimbursement are met. This requires new internal procedures and compliance with state-imposed documentation and eligibility standards. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
County: County agencies that administer or partner on port-related projects can now leverage their available funds by securing a letter of no prejudice. This change mandates adjustments in budgeting and recordkeeping to meet the reimbursement criteria established under the state program. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Special District: Special districts involved in port or freight infrastructure projects are directly impacted, as they may serve as lead applicant agencies and use the new financing option. These agencies will need to update financial oversight procedures and ensure coordination with state funding guidelines to obtain future reimbursements. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by agreements between multiple local agencies may indirectly benefit from this legislative change when involved in port projects. They must coordinate applications and compliance efforts among partnering agencies to qualify for the reimbursement mechanism. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)

                       The bill appropriates $100,000,000 from the General Fund to support the Active Transportation Program administered by the Department of Transportation. Funds will be allocated by the California Transportation Commission, with an allocation deadline of June 30, 2027 and a final encumbrance/liquidation deadline of June 30, 2030. Although the program is state-administered, local agencies may be indirectly impacted as they seek to participate in projects that promote active modes of transportation. Cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities could be required to update planning documents, coordinate inter-agency efforts, and comply with new eligibility and reporting requirements to access and manage these funds.

                       The legislative change authorizes the Department of General Services, with the consent of the DMV, to enter into a lease-purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility to replace the DMV field office in the City and County of San Francisco. Although primarily a state agency initiative, this change indirectly impacts local government bodies by potentially triggering new requirements around zoning, planning, and local regulatory oversight—particularly given the mixed-use development component that may integrate affordable housing.

                       City: The development of a mixed-use facility in San Francisco may require the city to adjust or expedite zoning approvals, building permits, and community review processes, especially with the potential inclusion of affordable housing features.
County: As the project is within the City and County of San Francisco, county-level agencies could face indirect impacts in coordinating infrastructure planning and regulatory oversight, particularly in monitoring compliance with state approval processes and the Property Acquisition Law.
