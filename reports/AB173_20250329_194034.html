                       This legislative change directs the Secretary of Transportation to work with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to review state transportation programs for available funding that can support grade separation projects at risk of losing federal or local funding commitments or facing schedule delays. The Secretary must report the identified funding to the Legislature by April 30, 2025.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislative change under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program allows a lead applicant agency to request a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation, permitting the agency to use its own funds on port-specific projects with the expectation of future reimbursement if certain conditions are met. The provision is temporary, becoming inoperative on 2033-06-30 and repealed on 2034-01-01, which requires affected local public agencies to act promptly if they wish to leverage this financing tool.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change increases the cap on administrative expenditures from 2.5% to 5% of the bond proceeds under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century. This amendment adjusts the allocation formula used for planning, engineering, and capital costs associated with high-speed rail development. It is a state-level financing issue and does not directly impact any of the designated local public agency types.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change requires the Department of Transportation to compile and report, on an annual basis beginning in 2025, information and analyses on the performance of its zero‐emission vehicle fleet (including details on charging and refueling facilities), with these reporting provisions set to expire on January 1, 2036. Although the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation generally targets the transition of local, state, and federal government fleets, the new statutory reporting burden is imposed only on state agencies. As a result, none of the local public agencies (e.g., School District, Charter School, County Office of Education, Community College, City, County, Special District, or Joint Powers Authority) are directly impacted.

                       The legislative change revises the funding allocation for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program. Under existing law, 25% of funds were set aside for planning and 75% for implementation. The new provision allows up to 25% for planning with the balance for implementation. This adjustment affects how project sponsors, typically large public entities, plan and structure their proposals, but it does not directly impose new compliance obligations on specific local public agencies.

                       The legislative change allows the Department of General Services, with DMV consent, to enter into a lease-purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build‐to‐suit office facility replacing the DMV field office in San Francisco. The project may evolve into a mixed-use development that can include affordable housing, potentially affecting local planning, zoning, and oversight responsibilities for local public agencies in the City and County.

                       City: The new state-led project in San Francisco may influence local planning and zoning decisions, especially if the mixed-use development integrates affordable housing. City officials may need to monitor and coordinate on potential land use and development review issues.
County: Since the project is located within the County of San Francisco, county agencies might have to review the impact of the lease-purchase agreement on local land use and property acquisition processes, ensuring compliance with the Property Acquisition Law.

                       The legislative change expands the responsibilities and oversight functions of the High-Speed Rail Authority’s Inspector General. It imposes new duties to review and investigate compliance with contract provisions on public and private entities receiving high-speed rail project funds, requires the inclusion of specific inspector general access provisions in all contracts executed on or after July 1, 2024, extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees, and revises budget notification protocols. These changes affect a state-level rail project and its contracting process; no local public agency (e.g., School District, Charter School, County Office of Education, Community College, City, County, Special District, or Joint Powers Authority) is directly impacted.

                       The legislative change expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program by including funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and imposing updated reporting requirements (updated regional short‐term financial plans and transit operator data) on regional transportation planning agencies for the 2025–26, 2026–27, and 2027–28 fiscal years. However, the provisions affect only the state Transportation Agency and regional transportation planning agencies and do not directly impact any of the local public agency types (School District, Charter School, County Office of Education, Community College, City, County, Special District, Joint Powers Authority).

                       The legislative change appropriates $100,000,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation for its Active Transportation Program. The funds will be allocated by the California Transportation Commission and are available until June 30, 2030. This change does not impose new compliance requirements or direct impacts on local public agencies (e.g., School District, Charter School, County Office of Education, Community College, City, County, Special District, Joint Powers Authority). Local agencies should monitor future Commission actions for any indirect opportunities.
