                           The legislative change revises the California School Finance Authority Act, allowing participating parties to request local intercepts for financing or refinancing projects. This involves sending a request to the county treasurer or fiscal officer, who, if agreeing, must make revenue transfers. The bill also limits school districts and county offices of education with qualified or negative financial certifications to intercept payments only for debts with probable repayment.

                           The legislative change extends the inapplicability of certain funding distribution provisions for school districts, community college districts, and direct elementary and secondary instructional services to the 2023–24 fiscal year. This means that the specific proration calculations for distributing state support funds will not apply for this fiscal year, continuing the exception that has been in place since the 1992–93 fiscal year.

                           The legislative change affects school districts and charter schools by delaying the requirement to maintain a 1:10 adult-to-pupil ratio in transitional kindergarten classrooms until the 2025–26 school year and removing the contingency on fund appropriation. It also extends the deadline for credentialed teachers to meet qualification criteria to August 1, 2025. Additionally, it introduces provisions for early enrollment children in transitional kindergarten, requiring concurrent enrollment offers in California state preschool programs and mandates reporting requirements for early enrollment children.

                           The legislative change authorizes the California College Guidance Initiative (CCGI) to provide its services to all local educational agencies (LEAs) and requires these agencies to include information about CalPADS and CCGI data in their annual parent notifications, as mandated by the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. This change impacts how LEAs manage and communicate data usage to parents.

                           The legislative change mandates that local educational agencies (LEAs) contracting with third parties for before and after school programs must ensure these third parties notify the LEA of any health or safety issues and request pupil health information from parents or guardians. This affects the operational and compliance aspects of LEAs and potentially cities and counties involved in such programs.

                           The legislative change modifies the existing requirement for school districts to use the uniform complaint process to address teacher misassignments. Previously, the process was triggered if a teacher lacking credentials or training to teach English learners was assigned to a class with more than 20% English learner pupils. The new requirement lowers this threshold to one or more English learner pupils, potentially increasing the number of complaints and the administrative burden on school districts.

                           The legislative change revises the provisions related to educator assignment monitoring and reporting by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and the State Department of Education. It mandates enhanced data sharing and transparency regarding educator assignments, including misassignments and vacancies, and expands the authority to regulate local educational agencies that consistently misassign educators. The bill also imposes new duties on county superintendents and local educational agencies, constituting a state-mandated local program.

                           The legislative change prohibits the state board from waiving laws related to kindergarten and transitional kindergarten admissions. This affects the ability of school districts and county boards of education to request waivers for these specific education laws, potentially impacting their flexibility in managing kindergarten admissions.

                           The legislative change revises the requirements for the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) template used by school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools. It mandates the inclusion of specific actions and goals for schools or pupil groups receiving the lowest performance level on state indicators and for those receiving Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier funding. This imposes new compliance requirements on local educational agencies, effective from the 2024-25 school year.

                           The legislative change amends the Education Code to include long-term English learners as a separate category within the numerically significant pupil subgroups for the public school accountability system. This change impacts local educational agencies by potentially creating new duties related to the evaluation and reporting of these subgroups.

                           The legislative change mandates county superintendents of schools to provide technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years to school districts with certain performance criteria and those failing to submit specified data. Additionally, for districts meeting performance criteria for 3 consecutive years, the geographic lead agency must collaborate with the county superintendent to provide assistance. This imposes new duties on county superintendents, creating a state-mandated local program.

                           The legislative change revises the intervention process for school districts and county offices of education by creating two separate processes. It mandates the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence (CCEE) to determine the necessity of its assistance and authorizes the Superintendent to intervene if the CCEE&#39;s recommendations are not implemented or if performance issues are severe. This imposes new duties on school districts and county offices of education, constituting a state-mandated local program.

                           The legislative change authorizes the California Department of Education to reallocate unexpended funds from the California Prekindergarten Planning and Implementation Grant Program to local educational agencies. These funds can now be used for educational expenses related to credentialing, permits, and professional development for preschool, transitional kindergarten, and kindergarten professionals. This change aims to enhance early childhood education by supporting professional development, particularly in inclusive classrooms and for dual language learners.

                           The legislative change modifies transportation funding provisions, making them inapplicable to school districts with an approved districtwide charter petition.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts with an approved districtwide charter petition will no longer be eligible for the transportation funding provisions that provide a 60% allowance of home-to-school transportation expenditures. This change requires affected districts to adjust their financial planning and transportation service offerings.
County Office of Education: County offices of education that oversee school districts with districtwide charter petitions may need to adjust oversight and support strategies due to changes in transportation funding eligibility.
Charter School: Charter schools within districts that convert to districtwide charter status may experience changes in transportation service availability and funding, indirectly affecting their operations.

                           The legislative change mandates the allocation of $3,500,000 from the General Fund to the State Department of Education for county offices of education. These funds are intended for purchasing and maintaining emergency opioid antagonists for school districts and charter schools. County offices of education must ensure that each middle school, junior high school, high school, and adult school maintains a minimum of two units of opioid antagonists. Additionally, up to $350,000 can be used for administrative costs. This change impacts county offices of education, school districts, and charter schools by imposing new responsibilities and funding allocations.

                           The legislative change revises the process for school employers to recover wage overpayments from school employees. It mandates written notification of overpayments, limits on installment payments, and requires legal action or arbitration if the overpayment is disputed. It also specifies that existing memorandums of understanding (MOUs) in effect as of July 31, 2022, will control until expiration or renewal.

                           The legislative change affects the operation and oversight of charter schools in California. It modifies the appeal process for charter petitions, extends the term of certain charter schools, and prolongs the prohibition on new nonclassroom-based charter schools. These changes impose new duties on local educational agencies, particularly those acting as chartering authorities.

                           The legislative change amends the Education Code to specify that local educational agencies must exempt individuals with exceptional needs, who entered the 9th grade in the 2022–23 school year or later, from additional coursework and requirements beyond state graduation requirements. It also revises eligibility criteria for an alternative diploma pathway.

                           The legislative change mandates local educational agencies (LEAs) serving kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 to adopt and implement screening instruments for assessing reading difficulties, including dyslexia. This requires LEAs to select from a state-approved list by June 30, 2025, and conduct annual assessments starting in the 2025-26 school year. LEAs must also provide support services for students identified as at risk. The bill appropriates funds for the creation of the screening list, impacting LEAs by imposing new compliance requirements.

                           The legislative change involves a conditional appropriation from the General Fund to the Superintendent of Public Instruction to augment funding for special education programs. This appropriation is contingent upon the revenues distributed to local educational agencies (LEAs) for special education being less than the estimated amount. If revenues exceed the estimate, the appropriation will be reduced accordingly.
