                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises the alternative education grant formula for county offices of education (COEs) by increasing the base grant component, modifying the calculation of average daily attendance, and establishing add-ons of $200,000 for COEs operating juvenile court schools and another $200,000 for those operating county community schools. The bill affects only county offices of education, not other local public agencies. COEs will experience a positive financial impact through increased funding, which will require adjustments to their budget planning and reporting processes beginning with the 2023-24 fiscal year.

                       This bill increases the base funding allocation that county superintendents of schools receive from $200,000 to $300,000 (a $100,000 increase), commencing with the 2023-24 fiscal year. County Offices of Education (COEs) are the local public agencies directly affected by this change, as they are responsible for providing differentiated assistance to struggling school districts in their jurisdiction. This increased funding will enhance COEs&#39; capacity to support school districts identified as needing additional assistance based on the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) accountability system.

                       This bill revises the California School Finance Authority Act by changing how school districts and county offices of education secure financing. Instead of electing to participate through their governing board and notifying the State Controller, participating parties can now request a &#39;local intercept&#39; through county treasurers or fiscal officers. The bill impacts school districts, county offices of education, and counties by shifting fiscal responsibility from the State Controller to county treasurers, and adds limitations for districts with qualified/negative financial certifications, allowing them to intercept payments only for indebtedness where repayment is determined probable.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill extends the suspension of certain state funding distribution calculations for school districts, community college districts, and direct elementary/secondary level instructional services for the 2023-24 fiscal year. School districts and community college districts are affected because these calculations determine how state funding is distributed among these educational segments. The impact maintains the status quo funding approach rather than reverting to the original calculation method, providing budget predictability for the affected agencies.

                       This bill establishes the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) Equity Multiplier apportionment, which annually appropriates $300 million from the General Fund beginning in the 2023-24 fiscal year. School districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that meet eligibility criteria as local educational agencies (LEAs) will receive additional funding (minimum $50,000 per eligible schoolsite) based on prior year enrollment figures. This funding targets educational equity, likely benefiting schools with higher concentrations of unduplicated pupils (English learners, low-income students, and foster youth), while requiring LEAs to participate in outcome tracking and reporting.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill extends the encumbrance period for a $15,000,000 appropriation from the General Fund to the Superintendent of Public Instruction from June 30, 2024, to June 30, 2025. This change primarily affects County Offices of Education (particularly the designated COE responsible for creating the repository) and Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) including school districts and charter schools. The impact allows these agencies an additional year to identify and curate high-quality open educational resources, giving them more time to utilize the allocated funds for this purpose.

                       This bill increases the funding allocation to the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE) from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 for supporting statewide professional development and leadership training related to antibias education and creating inclusive and equitable schools. This directly impacts LACOE by providing additional funding for their statewide educational programs. Other K-12 education agencies throughout California may be indirectly impacted as they are potential beneficiaries of the expanded professional development and leadership training programs that LACOE will be able to provide with this increased funding.

                       This bill delays the deadline for the Superintendent of Public Instruction to submit a report with recommendations from a statewide interest holder workgroup on best practices for universal preschool programs. The report was originally due by January 15, 2023, but will now be due by March 31, 2024. School districts and county offices of education that operate preschool programs are indirectly affected as they will need to wait longer for any potential changes to preschool program requirements that might result from these recommendations. The impact is minimal and does not require any immediate action from local educational agencies.

                       This bill authorizes the State Department of Education to reallocate unexpended funds from the California Prekindergarten Planning and Implementation Grant Program to provide grants to local educational agencies (LEAs). These grants would support educational expenses for current and future California state preschool program, transitional kindergarten, and kindergarten professionals to attain required credentials, permits, or professional development. School districts, county offices of education, and charter schools operating prekindergarten, transitional kindergarten, or kindergarten programs will benefit from this additional funding opportunity to help their staff develop competencies in early childhood instruction, inclusive classrooms, and dual language learners.

                       This bill modifies the uniform complaint process for school districts by lowering the threshold for complaints regarding teacher misassignment. Currently, complaints can be filed when teachers without proper credentials/training teach classes with more than 20% English learner students. The new law allows complaints when teachers without proper credentials/training teach classes with one or more English learner students. This change affects school districts by expanding the scope of potential complaints and requiring districts to ensure all teachers with any English learner students have appropriate credentials or training.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill makes two key changes to transitional kindergarten (TK) programs. First, it delays the requirement for schools to maintain a 1:10 adult-to-pupil ratio in TK classrooms until 2025-26 (previously 2023-24) and extends the deadline for TK teacher qualifications from August 1, 2023, to August 1, 2025. Second, it authorizes school districts and charter schools to enroll younger &#39;early enrollment children&#39; in TK programs under specific conditions for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years, with restrictions on counting these students for funding until they turn 5. These changes directly impact school districts and charter schools that operate TK programs by providing flexibility in staffing timelines while adding new options and requirements for early enrollment.

                       This bill prohibits the State Board of Education from waiving laws related to kindergarten and transitional kindergarten admission requirements. School districts and county boards of education are affected because they will no longer be able to request or receive waivers from these specific admission requirements. This impacts these local agencies by removing flexibility they previously had and requiring strict compliance with all kindergarten and transitional kindergarten admission laws without exception.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill enhances educational services for juvenile court-involved youth by establishing specific timeframes for educational evaluations and transition planning. It affects County Offices of Education (COEs), County Probation Departments, school districts involved with juvenile court schools, and local educational agencies receiving students post-detention. These agencies must now complete intake evaluations within 2-5 business days of a ward entering a juvenile facility, develop transition plans that must be transferred to post-placement educational agencies within 2 business days, and collaborate to provide expanded postsecondary educational opportunities to detained youth. The bill also imposes new reporting requirements and mandates the formation of a workgroup to address the needs of students with disabilities in these settings.

                       This bill appropriates $3,500,000 annually from the General Fund to the State Department of Education for county offices of education to purchase and maintain emergency opioid antagonists (like naloxone) for school districts and charter schools. County offices of education, school districts, and charter schools are affected because the legislation aims to maintain a minimum of two units of emergency opioid antagonists at each middle school, junior high school, high school, and adult school site. County offices of education will be responsible for coordinating purchases and maintaining a stock of these antagonists as a condition of receiving funds, with up to $350,000 allocated for administrative costs.

                       This bill changes how school meal funding is administered in California public schools. Currently, schools must provide free meals to all students who request them, with the Department of Education reimbursing for nonreimbursed expenses. The new law would instead require the State Department of Education to provide specific meal reimbursement for reduced-price and paid meals to school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that participate in federal meal programs. This affects how these educational agencies budget for, administer, and receive funding for their school meal programs.

                       This bill requires the Student Aid Commission to provide the California College Guidance Initiative with data necessary for educator reports tracking student completion of FAFSA and California Dream Act Applications. School districts, county offices of education, and charter schools with high school programs are affected because they employ educators who assist students with college financial aid applications. These educational agencies will benefit from improved access to data showing which students have completed their financial aid applications, allowing for more targeted support, though the bill does not impose new requirements on these agencies.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill modifies the public school accountability system to separately track and report performance data for both English learners generally and long-term English learners specifically, whereas previously only the broader &#39;English learners&#39; category was tracked. This change affects school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools, which must now update their data collection systems and reporting mechanisms to separately identify these student subgroups. As acknowledged in the bill, this creates new duties for local educational agencies and constitutes a state-mandated local program.

                       This bill establishes specific deadlines for the public reporting of performance data on state and local indicators via the California School Dashboard for the prior school year. It affects school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools by requiring them to adjust their data collection and reporting timelines to meet these new deadlines. These local educational agencies will need to modify their internal processes to ensure timely submission of data to the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS), which will be used for the Dashboard reporting.

                       This bill requires school districts and county offices of education that meet specified criteria to include in their Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAPs) or annual updates specific actions and services related to technical assistance aimed at improving outcomes for pupil groups that caused the district or county office to meet those criteria. This specifically impacts school districts and county offices of education that have been identified as needing improvement for certain student groups. These agencies will need to incorporate additional elements into their LCAP reporting and implement the technical assistance measures they outline.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill modifies requirements for county superintendents of schools regarding technical assistance to school districts. It now requires technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years (rather than an unspecified duration) to districts where student subgroups meet certain performance criteria. It adds new mandates for county superintendents to provide assistance to districts that fail to submit required data and requires collaboration between geographic lead agencies and county superintendents when districts meet performance criteria for 3+ consecutive years. These changes directly impact county offices of education by creating new mandatory duties, affect school districts with underperforming subgroups or data reporting issues, and create collaborative responsibilities for geographic lead agencies.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill modifies requirements for technical assistance provided by the Superintendent of Public Instruction to county offices of education (COEs). The changes affect only county offices of education, not other local public agencies such as cities, counties, special districts, or JPAs. Under this bill, COEs with underperforming pupil subgroups will now receive technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years (previously unspecified duration), and COEs that fail to submit specified data to the department will also receive technical assistance (a new requirement).

                       This bill establishes &#39;Equity Leads&#39; within California&#39;s educational support system by requiring the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to select local educational agencies (LEAs) through a competitive process by March 1, 2024. School districts, county superintendents of schools, and charter schools are impacted in two ways: (1) some LEAs will have the opportunity to apply and be selected as Equity Leads, receiving funding to provide support to other agencies; and (2) all LEAs, particularly those receiving Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier funding, will have access to support from Equity Leads to develop programs addressing racial disparities in educational opportunities and outcomes.

                       This bill expands the Bilingual Teacher Professional Development Program by broadening its purpose to increase bilingual teachers across multiple languages (Spanish, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, Arabic, and others), requiring quarterly meetings between the department and grant recipients, and appropriating $20 million to be distributed as $4 million annual grants from 2023-24 through 2027-28. This affects local educational agencies (school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools) that are eligible grant recipients, providing them additional funding opportunities for bilingual teacher development while establishing new reporting requirements and participation obligations.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill makes three significant changes to the Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialists Grant Program: (1) it adds new interim reporting requirements before final reports, requires independent evaluation of reports, and prohibits using funds for existing literacy staff salaries; (2) it appropriates an additional $250 million to expand the program to eligible schoolsites that didn&#39;t receive initial funding; and (3) it affects local educational agencies (LEAs) including school districts, county offices of education, and eligible charter schools that participate in the grant program. These agencies will face new reporting obligations, funding restrictions, and potential new funding opportunities if they contain eligible schoolsites that didn&#39;t receive the initial grants.

                       This bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to award $118,810,000 in federal Stronger Connections Grant Program funds to eligible local educational agencies (LEAs) on a competitive basis, subject to approval by the executive director of the state board. The funds specifically target school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that qualify under federal program requirements. These LEAs will have the opportunity to apply for grants to implement Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) activities focused on establishing safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments through integrated academic, behavioral, and social-emotional learning practices.

                       This bill appropriates $1,000,000 from the General Fund to the California Department of Education to create a Literacy Roadmap in consultation with the State Board of Education. This roadmap will impact school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools by providing resources to help educators implement effective literacy instruction, apply curriculum frameworks to classroom teaching, and improve literacy outcomes with a focus on equity. The impact is supportive rather than regulatory, offering educational agencies additional resources without imposing mandates.

                       This bill appropriates $7,000,000 from the General Fund to support local educational agencies (LEAs) that elect to implement restorative justice best practices on school campuses. School districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that qualify as LEAs are affected by this change, as they will have access to new funding if they choose to implement these practices. The impact is positive, providing financial resources to support restorative justice implementation, which aims to improve school climate and provide alternatives to traditional disciplinary approaches.

                       This bill appropriates $1,000,000 from the General Fund for the 2023-24 fiscal year to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to award as a grant to Beyond Differences, a community-based organization. This funding is specifically designated to support local educational agencies (LEAs), including school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools, with implementing high-quality integrated academic, behavioral, and social-emotional learning practices. The impact on these educational agencies is supportive rather than regulatory, providing them with additional resources to enhance their educational programming without imposing new mandates.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill extends the time period during which previously appropriated funds for the California Preschool, Transitional Kindergarten, and Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program remain available for encumbrance or expenditure. This change directly impacts school districts, which are the sole recipients of these one-time grants used to construct new facilities or retrofit existing school facilities for transitional kindergarten and full-day kindergarten classrooms. By extending the availability period of these funds, school districts gain additional time to access and utilize this funding for their facility needs.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill reduces the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund appropriation from $7,936,000,000 to $6,345,405,000 (a reduction of approximately $1.59 billion) and modifies the reporting requirements for fund recipients. The affected local public agencies include school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that received allocations from this COVID-19 pandemic recovery fund. These educational agencies will experience two significant impacts: (1) a substantial reduction in available funding for learning recovery initiatives (approximately 20% less), and (2) modified reporting requirements that now mandate annual interim expenditure reports rather than just two reports, with deadlines shifted from December 1 to December 15.

                       This bill extends emergency attendance protection funding for school districts into the 2022-23 fiscal year by requiring the State Superintendent to allocate 12.5% of the difference between districts&#39; 2020-21 and 2019-20 fiscal year funding entitlements. This continues the declining scale of attendance loss protection (from 100% in 2020-21 to 25% in 2021-22, now 12.5% in 2022-23) established to address decreased attendance during emergencies. School districts are the primary agencies affected, receiving additional funding without apparent application requirements.

Only school districts that had eligible small schools destroyed in the August 2021 state emergency are affected. These districts can maintain their funding levels as if the destroyed school were still operational for an additional year beyond what was previously authorized (2021-22 and 2022-23).

                       This bill modifies the Community Engagement Initiative Expansion by requiring that partnerships between school districts and community organizations include fiscal support to partner organizations. School districts participating in the initiative&#39;s professional learning networks are affected because they will now have a mandatory obligation to provide financial support to their community partners. This creates a new financial requirement for these districts to ensure their community partners have adequate capacity for meaningful collaboration and implementation of the initiative.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill modifies the funding structure for zero-emission schoolbuses by replacing the previous multi-year appropriation with a one-time allocation for the 2023-24 fiscal year only. Local educational agencies (LEAs) including school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools are affected as they are the designated recipients of these grants. The impact includes reduced overall funding ($375 million for schoolbuses and $125 million for infrastructure, down from higher amounts previously) and a shift from ongoing to one-time funding, requiring LEAs to adjust their long-term fleet electrification plans.

                       This bill appropriates $1,960,500,000 from the General Fund for the 2023-24 fiscal year to the State Allocation Board for new construction and modernization projects under the Leroy F. Green School Facilities Act of 1998. School districts are the primary agencies affected, as they are eligible to apply for these construction and modernization funds to improve their facilities. The bill also authorizes the Department of General Services to charge administrative costs (up to $15 million) against either this appropriation or the previous year&#39;s $1,300,000,000 appropriation.

                       This bill revises existing appropriations law affecting how local educational agencies (school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools) can utilize previously allocated funds for school meal programs. Specifically, it modifies the list of school food best practices eligible for funding, revises the definition of &#39;freshly prepared onsite meals,&#39; and authorizes the State Department of Education to provide interpretive guidance. These changes impact how educational agencies can spend funds for kitchen infrastructure upgrades and implementing school food best practices for federal meal programs.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill reduces the appropriation for the Arts, Music, and Instructional Materials Discretionary Block Grant by $200,000,000, changing the total from $3,560,885,000 to $3,360,885,000 for the 2022-23 fiscal year. This impacts school districts and other local educational agencies (LEAs) who were recipients of this block grant, resulting in reduced funding available for arts, music, and instructional materials programs. LEAs that had budgeted for these funds may need to revise their spending plans for these categorical areas.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill appropriates funds that will count toward the constitutional minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts under Proposition 98 (Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution). School districts and community college districts are directly affected as recipients of this funding. The impact is primarily financial, with these educational agencies receiving funds as part of the state&#39;s constitutional obligation to provide minimum funding for K-14 education.

                       This bill removes the requirement for the State Controller&#39;s audit guide to include instructions for determining if there are unspent funds associated with Charter School Facilities Program projects, Career Technical Education Facilities Program projects, and projects where local educational agencies received hardship funding. This change affects school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that participate in these facilities programs. These educational agencies will experience a reduction in administrative burden as they will no longer need to follow specific audit procedures for tracking unspent funds related to these particular facilities programs.

                       This bill exempts school districts with approved districtwide charter petitions from transportation funding provisions that apply to other school districts. Only school districts that have converted all their schools to charter schools (with approval from both the Superintendent and State Board of Education) are affected. These charter districts will no longer be subject to the requirements to develop specific transportation plans that prioritize service for transitional kindergarten through 6th-grade students and low-income pupils.

                       This bill modifies the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program by specifying licensing requirements based on whether programs are operated directly by local educational agencies (LEAs) or by third parties, establishing reporting requirements for off-campus programs, and extending the timeframe for expending allocated funds. The bill impacts school districts and charter schools that operate expanded learning opportunity programs by creating new licensing and reporting requirements and providing greater flexibility in the use of program funds across fiscal years. These LEAs will need to comply with new licensing requirements and potentially submit program access information annually if they contract with third-party providers for off-campus programs.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill makes several changes to charter school laws affecting school districts and county boards of education. First, it raises the standard for State Board of Education reversals of charter petition denials by requiring abuse of discretion by both the school district and county board. Second, it extends charter terms by one additional year for schools with terms expiring between January 1, 2024, and June 30, 2027. Third, it extends by one year (until January 1, 2026) the prohibition on approving new charter schools offering nonclassroom-based instruction. Fourth, it extends the timeline for &#39;acquiring charter school&#39; provisions. These changes directly impact school districts and county offices of education by modifying their charter oversight responsibilities and administrative processes.

                       This bill modifies Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) transparency requirements for educational agencies. For County Offices of Education (COEs), it requires more detailed breakdowns in their LCFF budget overviews, specifically addressing juvenile court schools, county community schools, and Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant funding. The bill affects school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools by requiring annual LCAP updates and budget overviews to be presented by February 28 each year at regularly scheduled board meetings, and expanding requirements for presenting these documents to various advisory committees.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill modifies who can request services from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence (CCEE) by limiting access to only school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that are eligible for certain technical assistance. It also authorizes the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (FCMAT) to request CCEE services. School districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and FCMAT are affected because the bill changes eligibility criteria for accessing CCEE services and maintains reimbursement requirements for these services as specified in the annual Budget Act.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill reduces the appropriation from the General Fund to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for charter schools from $413,000,000 to $290,023,000 for the 2022-23 fiscal year, a reduction of $122,977,000. This change directly impacts charter schools, which will receive less funding than originally allocated. The bill also indirectly affects charter school authorizers (school districts, county offices of education, and the State Board of Education) that may need to address oversight implications of this significant funding reduction for their authorized charter schools.

                       This bill requires the Legislative Analyst&#39;s Office (LAO) to provide recommendations by March 15, 2024, for changes to the local control and accountability plan (LCAP) for county offices of education, or alternative reporting requirements. County Offices of Education (COEs) are the primary agencies affected as the bill specifically targets their accountability reporting frameworks. While the bill itself only mandates recommendations rather than implementing changes, COEs may face modified reporting requirements in the future based on these recommendations.

                       This bill appropriates $100,000 for the 2023-24 fiscal year to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for allocation to the Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) to update distance learning curriculum and instructional guidance for mathematics in alignment with the state-adopted mathematics framework. The bill directly impacts SCOE, which will receive the funding and be responsible for developing the updated curriculum in consultation with state education officials. Other local educational agencies, including county offices of education, school districts, and charter schools across California, may be indirectly impacted as potential users of the updated curriculum resources, though the bill does not mandate adoption.

                       This bill appropriates $148,000 annually from the General Fund to maintain and support the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) Electronic Template System and its associated database and reporting interface, beginning with the 2023-24 fiscal year. This affects school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that are required to create and submit LCAPs as part of the Local Control Funding Formula requirements. These educational agencies benefit from continued maintenance of the electronic system they use to meet their existing LCAP reporting obligations, but the bill does not create new compliance requirements for them.

                       This bill revises wage overpayment recovery procedures for school employers. It affects school districts, county offices of education, community college districts, and other public educational employers by implementing stricter requirements for recovering overpaid wages from employees. Key changes include mandatory written notification of overpayments with specified rights, elimination of full repayment through payroll deductions for overpayments over one year old, revised installment payment limits, and a requirement that employers obtain a court order or binding arbitration decision before recovering disputed overpayments.

                       This bill enhances educator assignment monitoring by requiring the Department of Education to provide comprehensive data to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) about educator assignments, credentials, and vacancies. It affects local educational agencies (LEAs) including school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools by subjecting them to increased scrutiny of teacher assignments, expanded reporting requirements, and potential sanctions for consistently misassigning educators. County superintendents will face additional inspection duties for schools with high percentages of underqualified teachers, while all LEAs must provide more detailed assignment data and will be held more accountable for proper teacher placement.

                       This bill modifies teaching credential requirements by (1) requiring the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to issue comparable credentials to military service members and their spouses/partners who hold valid out-of-state credentials, and (2) exempting certain credential candidates from teaching performance assessment requirements. This change impacts school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that employ teachers by potentially expanding their hiring pool of qualified educators. These educational agencies may need to update their hiring processes and credential verification procedures to accommodate these new credentialing pathways.

                       This bill modifies the Teacher Residency Grant Program by: (1) changing service requirements so candidates can serve at any California public school rather than only within the sponsor&#39;s jurisdiction, (2) increasing the maximum grant amount from $25,000 to $40,000 per candidate, and (3) requiring a minimum $20,000 compensation package for candidates. These changes impact school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that participate in the Teacher Residency Grant Program. These agencies will need to adjust their residency program requirements, potentially receive larger grant amounts, and ensure they provide the required minimum compensation to residency candidates.

                       This bill establishes the Diverse Education Leaders Pipeline Initiative program, which provides grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to train, place, and retain diverse and culturally responsive administrators in TK-12 schools. School districts, county offices of education, and charter schools are affected as they are eligible to apply for grants of up to $30,000 per administrator candidate. These LEAs will benefit from this voluntary funding opportunity to develop diverse leadership, though administrator candidates must commit to serving in California public schools for at least two years.

                       This bill modifies graduation requirements for students with exceptional needs by specifying that exemptions from coursework requirements apply only to those who entered 9th grade in the 2022-23 school year or later, while also revising eligibility criteria for alternative diploma pathways. This change impacts local educational agencies (LEAs) including school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that serve as their own LEAs. These agencies will need to update their policies, procedures, and IEP documentation to reflect the new timelines and revised criteria for exemptions and alternative diploma options for special education students.

                       This bill requires the implementation of reading difficulty screening for K-2 students in California. It mandates that the state board appoint an expert panel to create an approved list of screening instruments by December 31, 2024, which local educational agencies (LEAs) must adopt by June 30, 2025. LEAs impacted include school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools that serve kindergarten through second grade students. These agencies must implement annual screening beginning in the 2025-26 school year and provide support services to students identified as at-risk for reading difficulties, creating new assessment and intervention responsibilities.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill extends the prohibition on school districts creating single-district Special Education Local Plan Areas (SELPAs) from July 1, 2024 to July 1, 2026, and requires the Superintendent to post all SELPA local plans online. It also establishes a specific funding allocation formula that SELPAs must use for the 2023-24 fiscal year when distributing special education funding to member Local Educational Agencies (LEAs). This impacts school districts by extending their inability to form single-district SELPAs, affects SELPAs by mandating a specific funding allocation methodology and online transparency requirements, and impacts LEAs within SELPAs by determining how their special education funding will be calculated for 2023-24.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill creates a funding safeguard for special education programs by appropriating General Fund money to supplement shortfalls in anticipated revenue from successor agencies. Local Educational Agencies (LEAs), including school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and SELPAs, are directly affected as they receive special education funding. If LEAs receive less revenue than expected from successor agencies for special education programs by June 30, 2024, they will receive supplemental state funding; conversely, if revenues exceed expectations, the related budget appropriation will be reduced accordingly.
                    </p>

                       This bill expands website posting requirements for Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAPs). Previously, school districts were only required to post LCAPs approved by their governing board, and county offices of education were only required to post LCAPs approved by their county board. Under this bill, school district superintendents must now post LCAPs that have been approved by both their governing board AND the county superintendent of schools. Similarly, county superintendents must post LCAPs approved by both the county board AND the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. These changes affect school districts and county offices of education by imposing additional compliance obligations for transparency and public access to fully approved LCAPs.

                       This bill removes an exemption that previously allowed county superintendents of schools with jurisdiction over a single school district to avoid preparing and submitting summaries of how they plan to support school districts in implementing Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAPs). County Offices of Education with jurisdiction over only one school district will now be required to prepare these LCAP support summaries, present them to the county board of education, and submit them with their own LCAP. This creates new administrative and reporting requirements for these specific county superintendents.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises the intervention process for underperforming county offices of education and school districts. It establishes a two-step process requiring first the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence (CCEE) to determine if assistance is necessary, and second allowing the Superintendent of Public Instruction to intervene if the CCEE determines the agency failed to implement recommendations or has persistently inadequate performance. County offices of education and school districts are directly impacted as they must now collaborate with CCEE in determining assistance needs and may face intervention under new criteria, potentially including modifications to their LCAPs and budgets.

                       This provision is standard mandate reimbursement language that appears in many California bills. It affirms that if the Commission on State Mandates determines the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement will be made according to existing statutory procedures. This provision potentially affects all local public agencies (cities, counties, special districts) and school districts by preserving their right to seek reimbursement for any state-mandated costs created by other parts of the bill. However, without information about what specific mandates the bill creates, the actual impact on local agencies cannot be determined.

                       This bill changes how fees collected by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) for tests, examinations, or assessments are handled. Starting July 1, 2023, these fees will be deposited directly into the Teacher Credentials Fund rather than a separate account, and will be exempt from fee reduction requirements when surplus funds exist. This change primarily affects state-level financial administration and does not directly impact local public agencies such as school districts, counties, or special districts, as it deals exclusively with internal fund management at the state commission level.

                       This bill expands the Golden State Teacher Grant Program to include students who commit to work at California preschool programs for 4 years, extends the credential completion timeline from 3 to 6 years, and allows grant recipients to continue satisfying their service requirement at schools that were on the priority list when hired. It also authorizes qualifying certain online nonprofit educational institutions for the program. This change affects school districts, county offices of education, and other public agencies that operate preschool programs by potentially increasing their pool of qualified teachers. Priority schools may also benefit from improved teacher retention as grant recipients can fulfill their service requirements at these schools even if they later fall off the priority list.

                       This bill appropriates $100,000 from the General Fund for the 2023-24 fiscal year to the California Department of Education to contract with an independent evaluator to extend the evaluation of certain technical assistance programs by analyzing California School Dashboard data. School districts and county offices of education are indirectly affected as their dashboard data will be analyzed, but the bill creates no direct obligations or requirements for local educational agencies. The impact on local educational agencies is minimal, as they are not required to take any specific actions related to this evaluation.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill makes technical and non-substantive changes by deleting obsolete provisions, making conforming changes, and correcting technical issues within existing law. Based on the limited information provided, this appears to be a clean-up bill that does not create substantive policy changes. No specific local public agencies are identified as being affected, and without details on which code sections are being modified, no significant impacts on local agencies can be determined.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill only includes a severability clause, which states that if any part of the bill is found invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining provisions would still remain in effect. Without information about the substantive provisions of the bill, it is impossible to determine which local public agencies would be affected or how they might be impacted. A severability clause alone does not create any direct requirements, deadlines, or impacts for local public agencies.
