<li>The proposed change to California law directly impacts local public agencies, particularly those involved in transportation and infrastructure projects. Local agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that are responsible for grade separation projects will need to adapt to new funding priorities and processes established by the Transportation Agency. The requirement for the Transportation Agency to prioritize funding for grade separation projects at risk of losing federal or local commitments means that local agencies may need to reassess their project timelines and funding strategies. Additionally, the reporting requirement to the Legislature introduces a new layer of accountability that local agencies must be prepared to meet. This change may necessitate adjustments in how local agencies plan and execute transportation projects, particularly in securing and managing funding.</li>

                            <ul>
<li>The proposed change expands the accountability program for the distribution of funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, requiring regional transportation planning agencies to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data for multiple fiscal years. This introduces new obligations for local agencies to ensure compliance with updated reporting requirements, which may necessitate adjustments in their operational processes and financial planning. Local agencies will need to allocate resources to gather and submit the required data, potentially impacting their budgets and operational workflows. Additionally, the modification of guidelines by the Transportation Agency may require ongoing adjustments to local agency practices to remain compliant with evolving requirements.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law introduces new obligations for local public agencies regarding the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Local agencies, including cities, counties, and special districts, will need to ensure compliance with the requirements set forth by the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. This includes potentially increasing their procurement of zero-emission vehicles and adapting their fleet management practices. Additionally, local agencies may need to report on their vehicle purchases and performance, which could require new data collection and reporting processes. The financial implications could be significant, as local agencies may need to allocate additional budget resources for the purchase of zero-emission vehicles and the installation of necessary charging infrastructure. Overall, the change necessitates operational adjustments and compliance measures that local agencies must address to align with state regulations.</li>

<li>The proposed change allows the Department of General Services to enter into lease-purchase agreements for a build-to-suit office facility, which may include affordable housing. This could impact local agencies, particularly in urban areas like San Francisco, as they may need to coordinate with state agencies on mixed-use developments that integrate affordable housing. Local agencies may also need to adapt their planning and zoning regulations to accommodate such developments, which could involve new compliance measures and operational adjustments. Additionally, the requirement for legislative notice and approval from the Department of Finance may necessitate changes in how local agencies approach real estate transactions and project approvals.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law imposes new obligations on local public agencies that receive high-speed rail project funds. Specifically, the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General will have the authority to review or investigate adherence to contract provisions of any public or private entity receiving these funds. This means local agencies must ensure compliance with contract provisions and may need to adapt their contracting processes to include specific access provisions for the inspector general. Additionally, the extension of whistleblower protections to contractor employees may require local agencies to revise their policies and training regarding reporting and handling of whistleblower complaints. The requirement for access to records and property will necessitate changes in how local agencies manage their contracts and may lead to increased administrative oversight and compliance measures. Overall, local agencies will need to be proactive in understanding and implementing these new requirements to avoid potential compliance issues.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program alters the funding allocation for planning and implementation phases. By allowing up to 25% of available funding for planning instead of a fixed 25%, local agencies may have more flexibility in how they allocate resources for projects. However, this could also lead to challenges in securing adequate funding for planning, which may require local agencies to adapt their project timelines and funding strategies. Local agencies will need to ensure they are prepared to meet the new funding structure and may need to adjust their operational processes to align with the new requirements. Additionally, the change may impact how local agencies engage with the Department of Transportation regarding grant applications and project planning.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program introduces new opportunities for local public agencies to utilize their own funds for eligible projects, with the potential for future reimbursement. This change allows agencies to initiate projects without waiting for state funding, which could expedite project timelines. However, it also requires agencies to manage their own expenditures and ensure compliance with the conditions set forth for reimbursement. Local agencies will need to adapt their financial planning and project management processes to accommodate these new responsibilities.</li>

<li>The proposed change to increase the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% directly impacts local public agencies involved in high-speed rail development. This change may affect how these agencies allocate their budgets and manage administrative costs associated with the implementation of high-speed rail projects. Local agencies may need to adapt their financial planning and reporting processes to accommodate the increased administrative funding, ensuring compliance with the new limits set by the Legislature. Additionally, the change could lead to enhanced administrative capacity for local agencies, allowing for more efficient project management and oversight.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Ebony Alert system introduces new obligations for law enforcement agencies, particularly in ensuring that all local resources have been utilized before requesting an alert. This requires agencies to develop protocols for resource assessment and information dissemination, which may necessitate training and operational adjustments. Additionally, the requirement for a report to the Governor's office and the Legislature by July 1, 2027, imposes a new compliance measure that local agencies must prepare for, potentially affecting their reporting processes and resource allocation.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law directly impacts local public agencies, particularly those involved in transportation and infrastructure projects. Local agencies such as cities, counties, and special districts that are responsible for grade separation projects will need to adapt to new funding priorities and processes established by the Transportation Agency. The requirement for the Transportation Agency to prioritize funding for grade separation projects at risk of losing federal or local commitments means that local agencies may need to reassess their project timelines and funding strategies. Additionally, the reporting requirement to the Legislature introduces a new layer of accountability that local agencies must be prepared to meet. This change may necessitate adjustments in how local agencies plan and execute transportation projects, particularly in securing and managing funding.</li>

<li>The proposed change expands the accountability program for the distribution of funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, requiring regional transportation planning agencies to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data for multiple fiscal years. This introduces new obligations for local agencies to ensure compliance with updated reporting requirements, which may necessitate adjustments in their operational processes and financial planning. Local agencies will need to allocate resources to gather and submit the required data, potentially impacting their budgets and operational workflows. Additionally, the modification of guidelines by the Transportation Agency may require ongoing adjustments to local agency practices to remain compliant with evolving requirements.</li>

<li>The proposed change to California law introduces new obligations for local public agencies regarding the transition to zero-emission vehicles. Local agencies, including cities, counties, and special districts, will need to ensure compliance with the requirements set forth by the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. This includes potentially increasing their procurement of zero-emission vehicles and adapting their fleet management practices. Additionally, local agencies may need to report on their vehicle purchases and performance, which could require new data collection and reporting processes. The financial implications could be significant, as local agencies may need to allocate additional budget resources for the purchase of zero-emission vehicles and the installation of necessary charging infrastructure. Overall, the change necessitates operational adjustments and compliance measures that local agencies must address to align with state regulations.</li>

<li>The proposed change allows the Department of General Services to enter into lease-purchase agreements for a build-to-suit office facility, which may include affordable housing. This could impact local agencies, particularly in urban areas like San Francisco, as they may need to coordinate with state agencies on mixed-use developments that integrate affordable housing. Local agencies may also need to adapt their planning and zoning regulations to accommodate such developments, which could involve new compliance measures and operational adjustments. Additionally, the requirement for legislative notice and approval from the Department of Finance may necessitate changes in how local agencies approach real estate transactions and project approvals.</li>

<li>The proposed change to the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program alters the funding allocation for planning and implementation phases. By allowing up to 25% of available funding for planning instead of a fixed 25%, local agencies may have more flexibility in how they allocate resources for projects. However, this could also lead to challenges in securing adequate funding for planning, which may require local agencies to adapt their project timelines and funding strategies. Local agencies will need to ensure they are prepared to meet the new funding structure and may need to adjust their operational processes to align with the new requirements. Additionally, the change may impact how local agencies engage with the Department of Transportation regarding grant applications and project planning.</li>
