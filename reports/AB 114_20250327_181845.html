                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises the alternative education grant by increasing its base grant component, modifying the average daily attendance calculation used for funding, and establishing additional add-ons for county offices of education that operate juvenile court schools and county community schools. It affects local public agencies such as county offices of education and school districts because these entities rely on the local control funding formula for state financing and are responsible for administering the grants. As a result, these agencies must update their funding calculation procedures and compliance measures to incorporate increased grant amounts and new block grant allocations starting with the 2023–24 fiscal year.

                       This bill increases the add-on funding provided in the local control funding formula allocation by an additional $100,000, effective with the 2023–24 fiscal year. It specifically affects local public school districts under the jurisdiction of county superintendents, particularly those identified as needing differentiated assistance. As a result, these school districts will receive enhanced funding that requires updates to budgeting and allocation practices to capitalize on the increased state support.

                       This bill amends the California Prekindergarten Planning and Implementation Grant Program by authorizing the State Department of Education to reallocate unexpended funds returned or collected from grant recipients. It specifically affects local educational agencies, primarily school districts, as they are the recipients of these state grants. The impact is that these agencies can now use such funds to cover costs associated with the educational expenses of current and future preschool, transitional kindergarten, and kindergarten professionals, including expenses for credential attainment, permits, and professional development, thereby requiring updates to budgeting and compliance practices.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The bill revises the allocation of fees collected for tests, examinations, or assessments by mandating that, effective July 1, 2023, all such fees be deposited directly into the Teacher Credentials Fund and exempting them from the usual surplus-based fee reduction requirements. No local public agencies (e.g., cities, counties, school districts, special districts, JPAs) are directly affected because the change only alters the fund management and budgeting process of the state-level Teacher Credentials Commission. As a result, the operational and fiscal adjustments are confined to the state education framework and do not impose new obligations on local public agencies.

                       This bill modifies the state apportionment funding method by mandating that, for the 2022–23 fiscal year, school districts receive an appropriation equal to 12.5% of the difference calculated based on their certified second principal apportionment entitlement between the 2020–21 and 2019–20 fiscal years. Only school districts are directly impacted because the change revises the funding formula specific to these agencies that have experienced emergency-induced declines in average daily attendance.

                       This bill extends the funding provisions for necessary small schools that were previously available for fiscal years 2021–22 and 2022–23 to now also cover the 2023–24 fiscal year. School districts are the affected local public agencies because they rely on these provisions when a school, eligible for necessary small school funding, is destroyed as a result of a state emergency. As a result, these districts must continue to report student attendance and teacher counts as if the destroyed school were still operational to secure the designated funding amounts in the extended fiscal year.

                       This bill extends the encumbrance period for a $15,000,000 appropriation—from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2025—for the county office of education tasked with curating a repository of high-quality open educational resources. The affected local public agencies include county offices of education and, by extension, the local educational agencies (such as school districts) that rely on the repository project. With an extra year to encumber funds, these agencies gain additional time to plan, secure, and deploy resources in support of educational initiatives.

                       This bill changes the education funding process by mandating that the Superintendent competitively award grants from $118,810,000 in federal funds (under the Stronger Connections Grant Program) to eligible local educational agencies. It affects local educational agencies—primarily K-12 school districts—because these agencies are designated to implement Multi-Tiered Systems of Support activities. As a result, affected agencies must prepare competitive grant applications and ensure that any awarded funds are used to create safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments with integrated academic, behavioral, and social emotional services.

                       This bill redirects certain appropriated funds to support compliance with the constitutional minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts under Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. In addition, the bill amends Education Code Section 52071.5 to require county offices of education to obtain technical assistance and revise their local control and accountability plans when necessary. As a result, school districts, community college districts, and county offices of education must adjust their budgeting, planning, and compliance procedures to align with the newly designated funding allocation and technical assistance framework.

                       This bill increases the additional funding provided under the local control funding formula for the Los Angeles County Office of Education, raising it from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 starting in the 2023–24 fiscal year. The affected local public agency is the Los Angeles County Office of Education because the change specifically adjusts its funding allocation meant to support statewide professional development and leadership training for education professionals in antibias education. As a result, the agency will have greater financial resources to enhance professional development programs and further its initiatives in creating inclusive and equitable school environments.

                       This bill amends the Early Education Act by delaying the reporting of a statewide workgroup’s recommendations on best practices for California’s state preschool program – moving the deadline from January 15, 2023 to March 31, 2024. It affects local public agencies such as school districts and local education agencies because these bodies are responsible for implementing the state preschool program and rely on timely guidance for program improvements and compliance. As a result, local agencies will need to adjust their planning, operational, and compliance schedules until the updated recommendations and related administrative guidance are issued.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises provisions under the California School Finance Authority Act by allowing participating parties to opt into a local intercept process via a direct request to the county treasurer or other appropriate fiscal officer instead of solely by a governing board action and written notice to the Controller. It affects local public agencies such as county treasuries/fiscal offices and school districts or county offices of education. County fiscal officers must process these requests with revenue transfers or apportionments, and school districts/offices with qualified or negative financial certifications will be limited to intercepting payments only for indebtedness where repayment is deemed probable.

School Districts and County Offices of Education: These agencies are now restricted to intercepting payments only for indebtedness with a probable repayment outcome, reducing their traditional leverage in short-term financings and requiring adjustments in financial and compliance protocols.

                       This legislative change makes the state’s previously mandated proration calculation for distributing educational support funds inapplicable for the 2023–24 fiscal year. It affects local public agencies such as school districts and community college districts because these agencies rely on state formulas for their budgeting and funding allocations. As a result, these agencies will need to adjust their financial planning and budgeting procedures to accommodate the change in funding distribution requirements.

                       School District: The exemption of the proration calculation for state funds in the 2023–24 fiscal year means school districts must revise their budgeting processes as they will no longer use the previously mandated allocation formula.
Community College District: Community college districts will similarly need to update their financial planning and resource allocation methods since the state-mandated distribution formula will not apply for the fiscal year 2023–24.

                       This bill revises existing law by updating the processes for collecting and reporting educator assignment data and expanding regulatory oversight related to teacher credentialing. It affects local public educational agencies—including school districts, charter schools, and county superintendents of schools—because these agencies are required to furnish detailed educator assignment information and adhere to heightened accountability measures. As a result, affected local agencies must implement new data reporting systems, prepare for increased state oversight regarding misassignments and teacher qualifications, and integrate additional duties that may affect inspection and reporting practices.

County Superintendents of Schools: County superintendents are assigned new inspection responsibilities and must report on schools failing to meet teacher credentialing standards, adding to their existing oversight functions.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends teacher credentialing rules by requiring the state’s Commission on Teacher Credentialing to issue a comparable, preliminary teaching credential to eligible military service members, their spouses or domestic partners, and surviving spouses or domestic partners, provided they submit proof of a valid, out-of-state, unexpired professional-level credential. Although the bill primarily adjusts state credentialing procedures, local public agencies—particularly school districts—are indirectly affected since they will be hiring educators who may hold credentials that are limited in duration and exempt from standard performance assessments. The change impacts these agencies by necessitating updates to recruitment, onboarding, and teacher evaluation practices based on the new credential timelines and exemption criteria.

                       School Districts: School districts may hire teachers with comparable credentials valid only for the duration of military orders (or up to three years for surviving spouses), and without the standard teaching performance assessment. This requires adjustments to hiring practices, evaluation protocols, and professional development planning. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)

                       This bill prohibits the state board from granting any waiver—whether in whole or in part—of the laws and regulations governing transitional kindergarten and kindergarten admission. It affects local public agencies that are responsible for education policy, specifically the governing boards of school districts and county boards of education, because these entities previously could request waivers for various education code provisions. As a result, these agencies will be required to strictly adhere to state-established admission requirements for transitional kindergarten and kindergarten, eliminating their flexibility to modify these regulations through waiver requests.

County Board of Education: County boards of education will be barred from requesting waivers for regulations on transitional kindergarten and kindergarten admission, reducing their ability to modify admission policies.

                       The bill mandates significant procedural changes for juvenile court schools by requiring that memoranda of understanding (MOUs) between education agencies and county probation departments include specific timelines. It affects local public agencies such as county offices of education, school districts managing juvenile court schools, and county probation departments because these entities are responsible for implementing the revised intake evaluation process and transition planning for wards, as well as collaborating on enhanced educational partnerships. The agencies are impacted through new compliance requirements including timely evaluations (within 2 business days, or up to 5 under extraordinary circumstances), rapid transfer of transition plans, updated online posting of MOUs, and additional reporting and evaluation mandates.

                       This bill amends current LCAP requirements by mandating that school districts and county offices of education that meet specified criteria include detailed actions and services for technical assistance aimed at improving outcomes for targeted pupil groups. The affected local public agencies are school districts and county offices of education because they are responsible for developing and updating LCAPs and, under the amended law, must now incorporate additional programming to meet state technical assistance criteria. As a result, these agencies will face new compliance, reporting, and budgeting obligations, marking the imposition of a state-mandated local program.

                       This bill mandates that county superintendents of schools provide technical assistance to school districts meeting specified pupil performance criteria for a minimum of 2 years, and to any district failing to submit required data. Furthermore, if a district meets these performance criteria for 3 or more consecutive years, its geographic lead agency must collaborate with the county superintendent to deliver technical assistance. The change affects local public agencies—specifically, county superintendents of schools and school district geographic lead agencies—by imposing new, state-mandated responsibilities that increase administrative burdens and require enhanced interagency coordination.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill changes the current law by mandating that the Superintendent of Public Instruction provide technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years to any county office of education where one or more specified pupil subgroups meet certain performance criteria. Furthermore, the bill requires the Superintendent to offer technical assistance if a county office of education fails to submit the specified data to the department. The local public agencies impacted are county offices of education because these agencies, when meeting performance or data submission triggers, are now subject to an extended period of technical assistance.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends the Community Engagement Initiative Expansion by mandating that any partnership formed under the initiative must now include an obligation to provide fiscal support to partner organizations. The change primarily affects local public agencies—most notably school districts and any designated lead agencies—as they are key players in convening the required community engagement professional learning networks and forming partnerships with community groups. As a result, these agencies must adjust their budgeting processes and partnership agreements to ensure they plan for and allocate the necessary financial resources to support collaborative community engagement efforts.

Lead Agencies (Local Authorities): Agencies serving as the lead in convening community engagement networks must ensure fiscal support is provided to their partner organizations, thereby necessitating enhanced financial oversight and coordination.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises the statutory framework for the California College Guidance Initiative (CCGI) by expanding its service authorization from only school districts to all local educational agencies and updating the parent notification requirements regarding the use of CalPADS and CCGI data under FERPA. Local public agencies—including school districts, county offices of education, and other local educational agencies—are affected because they must now incorporate additional data use disclosures in their annual parent notifications. Furthermore, agencies such as the Riverside County Office of Education face enhanced reporting obligations concerning the CCGI’s budget and partnerships.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends the Golden State Teacher Grant Program by expanding its service commitment requirement to include work at California preschool programs and extending the timeframe for earning a preliminary credential from 3 to 6 years after the first grant distribution. It also creates a new funding tier for students enrolled in qualifying private online postsecondary institutions by lowering the grant amount to $10,000 if specific nonprofit and operational criteria are met. Local public agencies impacted include school districts and local educational agencies that operate teacher preparation programs and priority schools, as well as public entities that manage California preschool programs, since these agencies will now serve as service sites and must adjust their tracking, reporting, and coordination processes in response to the modified service and repayment obligations.

California Preschool Program Operators: Operators of California preschool programs, including state-funded, tribal, and Head Start programs, are now designated as acceptable service sites for grant recipients, requiring them to work closely with state agencies on compliance and verification of service hours.

                       This bill revises the funding mechanism for converting heavy-duty internal combustion schoolbuses and upgrading supporting infrastructure. It affects local educational agencies—primarily school districts and related county education authorities—because they are the eligible recipients for grants to replace schoolbuses with zero-emission models and to install charging or fueling infrastructure. As a result, these agencies must adjust their planning and application processes to secure one-time, fiscal year 2023–24 grant funding instead of relying on recurring annual appropriations.

                       Local Educational Agencies: Local educational agencies will now need to apply for one-time grants during the 2023–24 fiscal year to fund zero-emission schoolbus replacements and infrastructure upgrades. This change eliminates the previously structured multi-year appropriations in favor of a single fiscal year allocation, potentially requiring accelerated planning and project implementation.

                       This bill appropriates $1,000,000 from the General Fund to develop a statewide Literacy Roadmap. It primarily affects local educational agencies—such as school districts and their governing boards—because these bodies are responsible for implementing and overseeing classroom instruction aligned with the state’s curriculum framework. Local agencies will be impacted by receiving detailed models and practical guidance for evidence-based literacy instruction, which will support professional development and curriculum adjustments to improve literacy outcomes with an emphasis on equity.

                       This bill appropriates $100,000 from the General Fund for the 2023–24 fiscal year to contract an independent evaluator to extend the evaluation of technical assistance provided under specific Education Code sections. The change primarily affects school districts, as they are the local public agencies whose performance data on the California School Dashboard will be analyzed. Although no new direct compliance requirements are imposed on these agencies, the evaluation outcomes may influence future modifications in technical assistance and support programs provided to them.

                       This bill deletes obsolete provisions and makes conforming as well as technical changes to the underlying code. No specific local public agencies (such as cities, counties, school districts, special districts, or JPAs) are directly affected because the bill is a housekeeping measure aimed at updating and clarifying the legal text rather than imposing new substantive requirements. Local entities may only need to review their internal documents to ensure they no longer reference outdated provisions.

                       This bill enacts a severability clause, ensuring that if any provision of the act is held invalid, the remaining provisions will continue to operate. No specific local public agencies (such as cities, counties, school districts, special districts, or JPAs) are directly affected because the change serves as a general legislative safeguard rather than imposing new regulations or compliance obligations. As a result, local public agencies will not experience new operational impacts or deadlines from this provision.

                       This bill introduces a change that establishes a reimbursement process whereby, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the act includes costs mandated by the state, local agencies and school districts will be reimbursed in accordance with established statutory procedures. It affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, special districts, and school districts because these entities incur expenses resulting from state mandates. As a result, these agencies must comply with the statutory provisions and procedures to secure reimbursement for their state-mandated costs.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends the existing law governing the After School Education and Safety Program by requiring that any local educational agency contracting with a third party for before and after school programs must include new provisions in the contract. Specifically, the third party must notify the local educational agency of any health- or safety-related issues by the next working day and submit a written report within seven days, and must also request pupil health information from parents or guardians before enrollment. The change directly affects local educational agencies (typically school districts) because they must update their contracts and oversight protocols to comply with these enhanced reporting and data collection requirements.

                       This bill amends the LCAP posting requirements by mandating that additional endorsements be included on public websites. Specifically, school district superintendents must now post board-approved LCAPs with an accompanying endorsement from the county superintendent, and county superintendents must post board-approved LCAPs with an additional endorsement from the Superintendent of Public Instruction. This change directly affects school districts and county offices of education by imposing extra state-mandated administrative duties and requiring enhanced coordination between local and state education officials.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends the current requirements for LCAP support by extending the mandate to county superintendents of schools with jurisdiction over a single school district. Previously, only county superintendents overseeing multiple school districts had to prepare, present, and submit a summary outlining how they would support schools and districts in implementing their Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAPs). With this change, even counties with one school district must comply, thereby imposing new administrative and reporting obligations on these local education agencies and their associated county boards of education.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises existing intervention provisions by establishing two separate processes for school districts and county offices of education. It requires that the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, in consultation with technical assistance providers and the agencies themselves, first determine if further assistance is necessary before the Superintendent, with state board approval, can intervene. Affected agencies—school districts and county offices of education—must now engage in this collaborative process and may face state-imposed measures, such as changes to local control and accountability plans, budget revisions, or the appointment of an academic trustee if their performance remains inadequate.

                       school district: School districts must collaborate with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. Failure to implement recommended reforms or persistent inadequate performance as measured by a state-approved rubric may trigger intervention measures, including revisions to LCAPs, imposed budget changes, and potential appointment of an academic trustee.
county office of education: County offices of education are now required to engage in a consultation process with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. If they fail to address performance deficiencies or implement recommendations based on an evaluation rubric, the Superintendent may intervene with measures similar to those for school districts, including changes to governance documents and budget revisions.

                       This bill mandates that the Legislative Analyst’s Office submit recommendations by March 15, 2024 for modifying the local control and accountability plan for county offices of education or proposing alternative reporting requirements. County offices of education are specifically affected because these recommendations will target their existing accountability plans and reporting frameworks. As a result, affected agencies may have to revise or streamline their plans to enhance transparency, simplify reporting, and better track educational funding and outcomes.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends the California Preschool, Transitional Kindergarten, and Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program by extending the period during which appropriated funds may be encumbered or expended. The change directly impacts school districts, a key local public agency, because they are the primary recipients of these one-time grants used to construct new facilities or retrofit existing ones for transitional kindergarten and full-day kindergarten classrooms. As a result, school districts now have an extended timeline to access and utilize these funds, which may benefit long-term planning but also requires adjustments to current project deadlines and budgeting processes.

                       This legislative change increases appropriations for school construction and modernization projects under the Leroy F. Green School Facilities Act by expanding funding—from $1.3 billion in 2022–23 to $1.96 billion in 2023–24—and authorizes up to $15 million in administrative cost charges. Local public school districts are the primary affected agencies because they rely on these funds for facility projects managed via the State Allocation Board. These agencies must adjust project plans, meet compliance requirements, and ensure that funds are properly expended by December 31, 2025.

It changes the interim reporting deadline from December 1, 2024, to December 15, 2024, and mandates annual interim reports thereafter, with the final report now due on December 15, 2029. The affected local public agencies are school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools because they are the entities designated to receive the fund allocations and are subject to compliance with detailed expenditure reporting requirements.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill removes the requirement that the Controller’s audit guide include instructions for determining if there are unspent funds related to Charter School Facilities, Career Technical Education Facilities, and hardship funding projects. It specifically affects local public agencies, namely local educational agencies such as school districts and charter schools, because these entities are involved in or receive funding under these programs. As a result, these agencies may experience reduced external audit oversight, which could necessitate bolstering internal controls to ensure proper fund utilization.

                       This bill exempts school districts that have received an approved districtwide charter petition from the mandatory transportation funding provisions. It specifically affects local educational agencies—namely, traditional school districts—because once a district&#39;s charter petition is approved, it is no longer required to develop, adopt, and annually update a comprehensive transportation service plan. As a result, chartered school districts will forgo the funding allowance and related compliance requirements, while non‐charter districts and county offices of education must continue to adhere to these obligations.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill introduces a new funding mechanism—the Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier—by appropriating $300 million annually from the General Fund beginning in the 2023–24 fiscal year. It affects eligible local educational agencies, including school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools (excluding nonclassroom-based charters), because these agencies generate local control funding formula entitlements. The change impacts these agencies by requiring them to allocate funds on a per-unit basis of each schoolsite’s prior year adjusted cumulative enrollment with a guaranteed minimum of $50,000 per eligible schoolsite, and by imposing annual reporting requirements on pupil outcomes.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts will need to integrate the new per-unit funding calculation into their budgeting processes, ensuring that each eligible schoolsite receives at least $50,000, and adjust internal operations to support evidence-based services using supplemental funding.
County Office of Education: County offices of education will be responsible for distributing the state-appropriated funds to schoolsites based on enrollment data, ensuring every schoolsite meets the minimum funding level and that funds supplement, without supplanting, existing resources.
Charter School: Eligible charter schools, as defined under the local control funding formula, will need to adopt the new funding formula based on their cumulative enrollment to receive the funding, while nonclassroom-based charter schools remain excluded.

                       This bill revises the Teacher Residency Grant Program by (1) increasing the grant award per residency candidate from $25,000 to $40,000, requiring a minimum compensation package of at least $20,000 for candidates in awards during and after the 2023–24 fiscal year, and expanding the service commitment from serving in the sponsoring agency’s jurisdiction to any public school in California for at least 4 school years, as well as extending the commission’s reporting deadline to December 1, 2029. (2) The affected local public agencies include school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and joint powers authorities because they are eligible to apply for and receive these grants to establish, expand, or enhance teacher residency programs. (3) These agencies must update candidate agreements, adjust budgeting and financial processes to handle the increased funds and mandatory compensation packages, and ensure compliance with the expanded service area and extended reporting requirements.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program by introducing distinct licensing requirements based on whether the program is operated directly by a local educational agency or by a third-party provider. It affects local public agencies such as school districts and charter schools—entities that run or contract for these programs—and also impacts California state preschool program providers due to new annual reporting mandates. As a result, these agencies must update their program plans to include the new licensing criteria, adjust processes for third-party contracted programs, and align their financial encumbrance timelines with the revised expenditure rules.

California State Preschool Program Providers: Providers are required to annually submit program access information to the State Department of Education, which will then disseminate a compiled report for licensing data collection purposes.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends transitional kindergarten requirements by delaying two key provisions. First, it postpones the mandate for maintaining an average of one adult for every 10 pupils until the 2025–26 school year and removes its funding contingency. Second, it extends the deadline for credentialed teachers (first assigned after July 1, 2015) to meet one of the specified qualification criteria until August 1, 2025. It also introduces new provisions for early enrollment children, requiring that schools concurrently offer state preschool enrollment when available and report compliance data. The affected local public agencies are school districts and charter schools because they operate transitional kindergarten programs and must adjust staffing, teacher certification timelines, and reporting practices accordingly.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises charter school appeal and renewal procedures by requiring that the state board reverse decisions only if both the school district and the county board of education are found to have abused their discretion, and it mandates additional term extensions for charter schools. It affects local educational agencies, specifically school districts and county boards of education that serve as chartering authorities, because they are responsible for making and reviewing these decisions and implementing renewal guidelines. These agencies must now update their administrative processes to document dual-agency findings of abuse and to accommodate new charter term extension and reporting requirements.

                       Local Educational Agencies (School Districts, County Boards of Education): These agencies must adjust their appeal review procedures to ensure that both the school district and county board are independently found to have abused their discretion before a charter petition decision can be reversed. They also need to implement the new rule for additional charter school term extensions, affecting their administrative and budgeting processes. (Deadline: March 01, 2024)
Legislative Analyst’s Office &amp; County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team: These offices are required to compile and submit a report detailing the processes used to determine funding for nonclassroom-based charter schools. (Deadline: March 01, 2024)

                       This bill appropriates $3,500,000 from the General Fund to the State Department of Education to be allocated to county offices of education. The funds are specifically targeted toward purchasing and maintaining a sufficient stock of emergency opioid antagonists at designated school sites, including middle schools, junior high schools, high schools, and adult school sites. Local public agencies affected are county offices of education, school districts, and charter schools, as they must coordinate and comply with the new requirement to maintain a minimum of two opioid antagonist units per designated schoolsite.

                       This bill revises the meal reimbursement process by shifting the responsibility from reimbursing nonreimbursed free meal expenses under federal programs to providing state meal reimbursement for reduced-price and paid meals. It affects local public agencies in the education sector – specifically, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools – because these agencies participate in the federal School Breakfast Program and National School Lunch Program and must now meet additional state requirements. As a result, affected agencies will need to update their reimbursement claim processes, adjust budgeting practices, and ensure compliance with new state guidelines to secure state funding for non-free meal expenses.

                       This bill revises and recasts the requirements for local control and accountability plans (LCAPs) by mandating that the state board’s template include an updated summary of the stakeholder engagement process – now explicitly covering stakeholders at schools generating Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier funding. The affected local public agencies are school districts, county offices of education (or boards), and charter schools because they are required to adopt and update LCAPs under the state board’s template. These agencies are impacted by needing to update their LCAP templates and procedures to include detailed stakeholder engagement documentation, corrective actions if any school or pupil group receives the lowest performance level on state indicators, and specific performance goals for schools receiving multiplier funding, with these changes taking effect in the 2024–25 LCAP cycle.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must incorporate an enhanced stakeholder engagement summary that includes input from multiplier funding stakeholders, develop corrective action plans when schools or pupil groups receive the lowest state performance levels, and establish specific performance goals for schools receiving multiplier funding.
County Offices of Education: County offices of education are required to follow the state board’s revised LCAP instructions, ensuring that their local plans include the enhanced stakeholder engagement documentation and appropriate remedial actions where schools underperform.
Charter Schools: Charter schools must update their LCAPs to reflect the new requirements, including a detailed stakeholder engagement summary and the establishment of corrective actions and specific performance goals for schools generating multiplier funding.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill makes targeted changes to the reporting requirements for local public agencies by mandating additional content in the local control funding formula budget overview and imposing new presentation deadlines for charter schools and school districts. County offices of education are affected because they must now separately report add-on funding for juvenile court schools, county community schools, and the Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant as part of their annual overview. Charter schools and school districts (including county boards and superintendents) are impacted by having to present a combined report on the annual update to the LCAP and the funding formula budget overview at a regularly scheduled meeting on or before February 28 each year, thereby increasing their administrative and compliance obligations.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends Education Code Section 52052 by requiring that the public school accountability system separately measure long-term English learners apart from the broader category of English learners. Local educational agencies – including school districts, charter schools, and county offices of education – are affected because they are responsible for implementing state-mandated accountability and reporting requirements. Consequently, these agencies must update their data collection systems and evaluation protocols to track long-term English learners as a distinct subgroup, potentially resulting in increased administrative duties and system modifications.

                       This bill mandates that public reporting of performance data on state and local indicators be completed via the California School Dashboard on or before specified deadlines for the prior school year. It affects local educational agencies—specifically school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools—because these agencies rely on the existing system for evaluating institutional performance. As a result, these agencies must adjust their internal data collection timelines via the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System and ensure timely public reporting, thereby incurring new compliance and administrative duties as part of a state-mandated local program.

                       This bill introduces a new competitive process requiring that by March 1, 2024, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence and the department select local educational agencies—or consortia of such agencies—to serve as Equity Leads. The affected agencies are primarily school districts and charter schools, as they qualify as local educational agencies and are central to California’s system of public education. Once designated as Equity Leads, these agencies will take on enhanced roles in analyzing programs, identifying barriers, and disseminating best practices to address racial disparities, with priority given to those with schools receiving Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier funding.

                       This bill changes the criteria for accessing advice and assistance from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. Previously, any school district, county office of education, or charter school could request services and reimburse costs; now, only those eligible for designated technical assistance may do so. Additionally, the bill authorizes the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team to request these services and mandates that they reimburse costs, thereby affecting these local public agencies by tightening eligibility requirements and introducing new reimbursement obligations.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends the Bilingual Teacher Professional Development Program by expanding its purpose to include increasing bilingual teachers in a broader array of languages (e.g., Spanish, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, Arabic) to staff bilingual classrooms. It affects eligible local educational agencies — including county offices of education, school districts, charter schools, and consortia — because these agencies are key grant recipients tasked with delivering professional development services under the program. As a result, these agencies must now adjust their professional development initiatives to incorporate expanded language offerings, participate in quarterly meetings with the department to share practices and resolve implementation issues, and meet updated reporting deadlines (a preliminary report by July 1, 2026, and a final report by January 1, 2029).

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends Education Code Section 60642.7 to clarify that any interim assessments offered by the department to local educational agencies are solely for improving instruction through timely teacher feedback, enhanced communication with parents, and guidance for teacher professional development, and not for high-stakes decisions. Local educational agencies—primarily school districts and charter school authorizers—are affected because they are the recipients of these assessments. As a result, these agencies must ensure that they do not use interim assessment results for purposes such as teacher evaluations, student grade promotion or retention, graduation decisions, or any other high-stakes determinations.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill reduces the state appropriation for charter schools from $413,000,000 to $290,023,000 for the 2022–23 fiscal year, a cut of $122,977,000. The change directly affects charter schools, which are public agencies operating under state oversight that rely on these funds for their operations. As a result, impacted charter schools will need to adjust their budgets, reallocate resources, and potentially scale back programs to comply with the reduced funding level.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises the list of school food best practices and updates the definition of &#39;freshly prepared onsite meals&#39; used in two funding programs. The changes affect local educational agencies—including school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools—that participate in federal meal programs because these entities receive the appropriated funds. As a result, these agencies must adhere to revised allocation formulas, eligibility criteria, attestation requirements (such as ensuring a minimum percentage of meals are freshly prepared onsite), and reporting deadlines.

                       This bill reduces the appropriation for the Arts, Music, and Instructional Materials Discretionary Block Grant for the 2022–23 fiscal year by $200 million, lowering the funding from $3,560,885,000 to $3,360,885,000. Local educational agencies—including county offices of education, school districts, charter schools, and state special schools—are impacted because these agencies are the designated recipients of the grant funds. As a result, affected agencies will need to adjust their budgets and expenditure plans, including holding public meetings to approve spending plans, and must allocate funds proportionately based on average daily attendance, with funds available for encumbrance through the 2025–26 fiscal year.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises the existing Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialists Grant Program by recasting its reporting requirements, adding mandatory interim reports and an independent evaluation process, and prohibiting funds from being used for the salaries of existing literacy coaches and reading specialists. It affects local educational agencies – including elementary and unified school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools – because they are the recipients of these grant funds and must comply with the updated reporting, fund usage, and evaluation provisions. As a result, these agencies must adjust their internal compliance and reporting systems to meet new interim and final deadlines while ensuring that the funds are used solely for hiring and training new staff or supporting new initiatives rather than covering current salary expenses.

They are also prohibited from using funds to support salaries of existing personnel. (Deadline: June 30, 2024)
Local Educational Agencies: Agencies with eligible schoolsites that did not initially receive funding will receive allocations under an augmented program, subject to similar reporting and evaluation obligations with later deadlines. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)

                       This bill establishes the Diverse Education Leaders Pipeline Initiative by directing funding from the Superintendent of Public Instruction to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. The program provides grants to local educational agencies—which include school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools—to train, place, and retain diverse and culturally responsive administrators in transitional kindergarten through grade 12. As a result, these agencies must implement new grant application procedures, enforce a two‐year service commitment for awarded candidates, and establish monitoring and reporting systems to ensure continued compliance.

                       This bill appropriates $7,000,000 from the General Fund to support the implementation of evidence‐based restorative justice best practices on school campuses by local educational agencies. In effect, the funding targets local educational agencies—including school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools—because these agencies are responsible for campus discipline and educational programs. As a result, affected agencies can apply for grants (up to $100,000 each) to implement the posted best practices, and they must comply with the application process, spending guidelines, and reporting requirements set by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.

                       This bill appropriates $148,000 annually from the General Fund starting in the 2023–24 fiscal year to maintain and support the Local Control and Accountability Plan Electronic Template System along with a dedicated database and reporting interface. It affects local education agencies—specifically school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools (through their authorizing districts)—because the amended Education Code Section 52065 requires these agencies to prominently post their local control and accountability plans and any subsequent updates on their websites. As a result, these agencies must update their online posting procedures, ensure timely compliance with new reporting requirements, and coordinate internally to manage the updates mandated by the law.

                       This bill appropriates $1,000,000 from the General Fund for the 2023–24 fiscal year to support local educational agencies by awarding a grant to the community-based organization Beyond Differences. The funding is aimed at helping agencies—primarily school districts and charter schools—implement high-quality, integrated academic, behavioral, and social-emotional learning practices. These agencies are impacted because they may receive programmatic support and will need to align their practices with the grant guidelines and performance expectations established through this initiative.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislative package, effective immediately as provided for in the Budget Act of 2023, implements statutory changes and appropriations affecting a broad range of education-related programs. The changes update funding formulas, accountability plan templates, teacher credentialing processes, procurement for zero-emission school buses, opioid antagonist stocking, and bilingual professional development. Local educational agencies—including school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools—must adapt to new compliance requirements, reporting protocols, and expenditure deadlines to ensure their continued funding and proper operation.

                       Local Educational Agencies (School Districts, County Offices, Charter Schools): Revised local control funding formulas and updated accountability plan templates require agencies to modify budgeting and reporting procedures. Agencies must ensure that their local control and accountability plans align with the new state board templates and adhere to specified submission deadlines. (Deadline: October 08, 2023)
Teacher Credentialing Entities: The Commission on Teacher Credentialing must establish an efficient transcript review process for candidates seeking basic skills and subject matter competence determinations, streamlining the credentialing process and reducing barriers to entry. (Deadline: November 15, 2023)
Local Educational Agencies - Transportation: Agencies receiving appropriations for zero-emission school buses must develop and implement procurement plans for purchasing vehicles and the related charging or fueling infrastructure. Funds must be expended within three fiscal years after receipt to avoid reversion.
County Offices of Education: County offices are required to purchase and maintain a minimum stock of emergency opioid antagonists for distribution to local educational agencies. They must also coordinate training on how to administer these drugs. (Deadline: June 30, 2029)
Bilingual Teacher Professional Development Programs: Local educational agencies may access competitive grants to support bilingual teacher professional development. These grants aim to improve instructional strategies and are available for several fiscal years. (Deadline: June 30, 2029)

                       The bill modifies the uniform complaint process by lowering the threshold for teacher misassignment complaints. Under the new provision, a complaint can be filed when a teacher who lacks credentials or training is assigned to a class with one or more English learner pupils, instead of only when over 20% of the class comprises English learners. This change affects school districts because they are required to update their established complaint procedures and notifications, thereby implementing a new state-mandated local program.

                       The bill narrows the exemption policy for individuals with exceptional needs by stipulating that only students who entered 9th grade in the 2022–23 school year or later, and who meet revised eligibility criteria, may be exempted from additional coursework and requirements. This change specifically affects local educational agencies—including school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and state special schools—because these agencies are responsible for implementing individualized education program (IEP) processes and graduation pathways. As a result, these agencies must update their procedures, adjust eligibility assessments for the alternative diploma pathway, and ensure timely parental notification before students commence grade 10.

                       This bill mandates that the state board appoint an independent panel of experts to develop an approved list of screening instruments for assessing reading difficulties—including dyslexia—in kindergarten through grade 2. It directly affects local educational agencies (school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools) because they serve pupils in these grades. These agencies are required to adopt one or more screening instruments from the approved list by June 30, 2025, and to commence annual screenings (starting in the 2025–26 school year) along with providing tailored supports and services for pupils identified as at risk.

                       The bill extends the prohibition on submitting a consolidated single-district special education local plan—from previously ending July 1, 2024—to now ending July 1, 2026. It also requires that the Superintendent post all local plans submitted by each special education local plan area on the department’s website, and mandates a new funding allocation formula for the 2023–24 fiscal year based on the prior year’s base funding, an inflation factor, and changes in average daily attendance. This change affects special education local plan areas, which primarily include school districts and charter schools acting as local educational agencies, because they must now comply with the extended prohibition, enhanced transparency requirements, and a new, state-mandated funding allocation process.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill mandates that by June 30, 2024, the Director of Finance determine and appropriate funds from the General Fund to augment the Budget Act of 2023’s special education funding. It affects local educational agencies—primarily school districts—because these agencies receive special education revenues from successor agencies, and the extra funds will only be available if these revenues fall short of the estimated amounts. In practice, if the actual revenues exceed the estimates, the appropriation will be reduced correspondingly, directly impacting the budgeting and resource allocation for special education programs in these local agencies.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill revises procedures related to wage overpayment recovery and establishes a Classified School Employee Summer Assistance Program while also addressing overpayment recovery from the Education Protection Account. Local educational agencies—namely school districts and county offices of education—are affected because they serve as school employers responsible for implementing these new overpayment notice and recoupment requirements and for electing to participate in the summer assistance program. As a result, these agencies must update their payroll practices, adhere to new notification and filing deadlines, and adjust budgeting processes to accommodate fund recovery provisions.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       Local Educational Agencies: Agencies must now provide written notification to school employees regarding wage overpayments, limit full repayment via payroll deductions for overpayments older than one year, and require a legal process (court order or binding arbitration) when disputes arise over the amount owed.
Local Educational Agencies: Agencies that elect to participate must follow strict notification and enrollment deadlines, segregate withheld funds into a separate account, and commit to the program for the upcoming school year once participation is confirmed.
Local Educational Agencies: Due to a decline in account revenue, the bill mandates recovery of overpaid Education Protection Account funds from agency payments, necessitating adjustments in budgeting and fiscal management. (Deadline: August 15, 2023)

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends current law by requiring the Student Aid Commission to provide discrete data to the California College Guidance Initiative, which in turn supports educator reports. Local public agencies, specifically school districts, are affected because educators in these agencies rely on the reports to verify that every pupil has completed and submitted their Free Application for Federal Student Aid or California Dream Act Application. As a result, school districts must update their compliance and follow-up procedures to integrate this new information into their oversight of student financial aid application submissions.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill amends CalPADS requirements by mandating that local educational agencies submit pupil data in accordance with department-established processes and timelines. It specifically affects local educational agencies—primarily school districts responsible for elementary and secondary education—because they must now follow new procedures to retain and report individual pupil records for each test taker to comply with federal law. As a result, these agencies face additional compliance obligations and will need to update their data management practices to meet the new state-mandated reporting requirements.
