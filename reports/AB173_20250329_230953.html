                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change revises state transportation funding processes to support grade separation projects that are at risk of losing federal and local funding or facing schedule delays. It requires the Secretary of Transportation to coordinate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify available funding and to potentially reallocate that funding directly to these projects, with a report due to the Legislature by April 30, 2025. Although the primary mechanism is state-driven, local agencies involved in transportation projects may be indirectly affected through changes in funding commitments, program participation, and project scheduling.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities involved in local transportation and grade separation projects may see changes in funding flows and matching fund requirements as the state reallocates money. This could affect local budgeting, project timelines, and coordination with state agencies.
County: Counties partnering in transportation improvement projects may be impacted if state reallocation of funds alters local funding contributions or matching requirements. Counties will need to adjust plans and possibly re-evaluate local funding strategies.
Special District: Special Districts responsible for specific transportation services might encounter adjustments in funding allocations that influence their capital improvement plans, requiring updates to project schedules or matching contributions.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that facilitate interagency transportation projects may need to renegotiate cost-sharing arrangements if state reallocated funds reduce the need for local contributions or alter expected funding formulas.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program to include funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the formula-based Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. As a result, regional transportation planning agencies – and by extension the local governmental bodies that participate in or are affiliated with these agencies – face new compliance requirements for submitting updated regional short‐term financial plans and transit operator data. These changes impact local entities involved in transit planning and funding, requiring them to adjust their internal processes to meet the revised reporting and funding guidelines.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that participate in regional transportation planning or oversee local transit operations will be indirectly affected. They may need to coordinate with regional agencies to update and submit financial plans and transit operator data in order to secure funding under the expanded accountability program.
County: Counties involved in regional transportation planning or that host local transit operations must comply with new submission requirements. They will need to update their regional short‐term financial plans and transit operator data to continue accessing appropriated funds from both the General Fund and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
Special District: Special Districts, particularly those managing transit services or infrastructure projects, will be impacted by modifications to the funding accountability guidelines. They must adjust reporting practices to meet the new data submission requirements to remain eligible for funding.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that manage multi-jurisdictional transit and transportation projects will need to implement the updated reporting requirements. This includes submitting updated financial information and transit data, ensuring that all member agencies are coordinated to comply with the new accountability program.

                       The legislative change enacts the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation, which, under the authority of the State Air Resources Board, mandates the transition of government fleets to zero‐emission vehicles. While the regulation explicitly sets reporting and procurement milestones for state entities, its scope includes local government fleets as well. This means that cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities may need to adjust their fleet management, procurement practices, and infrastructure planning—even if indirectly—to align with the new zero-emission requirements and evolving state reporting protocols.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that operate fleets of medium- and heavy-duty trucks (e.g., for public works, maintenance, and other municipal services) must prepare to transition a portion of new vehicle acquisitions to zero-emission models. They will need to review their fleet composition, update procurement policies, and plan for the installation of EV charging/refueling infrastructure in alignment with emerging state regulations. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
County: Counties, as providers of various public services, also operate fleets that may include medium- and heavy-duty trucks. They must assess their vehicle inventory, update purchasing practices, and potentially invest in charging and refueling infrastructure to meet the impending zero-emission transition requirements. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Special District: Special districts that manage specific public services (such as water, sanitation, or fire services) and operate truck fleets are indirectly affected by the regulation. They will need to align their vehicle acquisition and infrastructure planning with the state’s clean fleet goals. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, which are formed by multiple public agencies to share services, may be impacted if they operate fleet vehicles. They should coordinate across member agencies to ensure that fleet modernization efforts—including the procurement of zero-emission vehicles and deployment of charging/refueling stations—are executed in a timely fashion. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change expands the oversight authority of the High-Speed Rail Authority’s Inspector General by requiring that all contracts and contract amendments involving high‐speed rail project funds include explicit provisions granting the Inspector General access to records and property. It also extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees and clarifies the scope of &#39;personnel issues.&#39; Although this change targets state-level operations, local agencies that contract with or receive high‐speed rail project funds—such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities—may be indirectly affected by new contract compliance, audit, and oversight requirements.

                       City: Cities that participate in high-speed rail projects by entering into contracts or receiving project funds must update their contract language to include provisions that guarantee Inspector General access to records and property. They also need to adjust internal policies in light of extended whistleblower protections for contractor employees. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
County: Counties acting as contracting entities or recipients of high-speed rail project funds must amend their contracts to include the mandated oversight provisions. They should also prepare for increased audit and review processes by the Inspector General. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
Special District: Special Districts involved in high-speed rail projects must ensure that all contracts funded by high-speed rail monies include provisions for Inspector General access. They will also need to update oversight practices to align with the new audit and investigation mandates. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The bill amends the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation formula. Instead of a fixed 25% of funds dedicated to planning and 75% to implementation, the new law requires that up to 25% of available funds be reserved for planning, with the remaining available for implementation. This shift in funding criteria may require local agencies to revise their grant proposals, budgeting processes, and project planning efforts in order to align with the updated state guidelines.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities participating in or partnering on the pilot program will need to update their grant proposals and budgeting practices to accommodate the flexible planning fund allocation. This may involve re-assessing project scopes, timelines, and administrative processes to align with the new state guidelines.
County: Counties, as major local government entities involved in transportation projects, must adjust their application and financial management processes to reflect the new division of funds. This change may affect project planning and require coordination with state DOT updates.
Special District: Special Districts that participate in or partner on projects under the pilot program will need to review and update their compliance and fiscal management practices due to the modified planning versus implementation funding split.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, formed by multiple local agencies to manage shared projects, will be impacted by the new funding allocation guidelines. They must ensure that collaborative grant proposals and planning documents accurately reflect the potential for less than a fixed 25% planning allocation.

                       This legislative change authorizes lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice. With this letter, a lead applicant—such as a city, county, special district, or joint powers authority—may use its own funds to invest in approved port infrastructure projects and later claim reimbursement from program moneys, subject to meeting specific eligibility conditions. The provision is temporary, becoming inoperative on 2033-06-30 and repealed on 2034-01-01, requiring affected agencies to adjust their funding, budgeting, and compliance processes accordingly.

                       The bill appropriates $100 million from the General Fund to support the Department of Transportation’s Active Transportation Program, intended to encourage biking and walking infrastructure improvements. Although the funds are allocated at the state level via the California Transportation Commission, local agencies—through their participation in metropolitan planning organizations or joint initiatives—may be indirectly impacted. Affected local bodies must plan project proposals, coordinate with regional agencies, and ensure compliance with new timelines and eligibility criteria.

                       City: Cities may need to update their transportation plans and develop active transportation projects to qualify for state-allocated funds. They are expected to coordinate with regional planning bodies to align local projects with the program goals. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
County: Counties are likely to be required to adjust local transportation plans and work with metropolitan planning agencies to secure funding for active transportation projects. This involves integrating state guidelines into local project development. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Special District: Special Districts responsible for local infrastructure improvements may become eligible for project funding under the program. They must meet specific state guidelines and eligibility criteria for active transportation initiatives. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by multiple local agencies to manage regional projects will need to coordinate joint, multi-jurisdictional proposals in order to leverage the appropriated funds effectively. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)

                       The legislative change authorizes the Department of General Services, with DMV consent, to enter into a lease-purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility replacing the DMV field office in San Francisco. The project, which may incorporate mixed-use and affordable housing elements, requires adherence to specific legislative notice requirements, approval by the Department of Finance, and compliance with the Property Acquisition Law. Although the primary transaction is state-level, local public agencies in San Francisco may be indirectly impacted through zoning, planning, and coordination requirements.

County: San Francisco County, as the local governmental body, must liaise with state authorities to ensure that the project meets local infrastructure and land use guidelines, especially with potential affordable housing components influencing county services and regulatory oversight.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The bill amends the high‐speed rail bond act by increasing the maximum percentage of bond proceeds that may be used for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5%. Although the change targets state-level funding allocation for planning and engineering of the high-speed rail system, it may indirectly affect local agencies involved in regional transportation planning, permitting, and coordination with state agencies.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that the high-speed rail routes traverse or affect may face changes in coordination and permitting processes. Increased administrative funding could mean more state-level oversight and altered project management protocols affecting local urban planning.
County: County governments, responsible for regional permits and land-use reviews, may need to update their compliance and coordination processes as a larger administrative allocation could shift oversight responsibilities in high-speed rail projects.
Special District: Special districts, especially those involved in transit or infrastructure development, might experience indirect impacts through revised funding allocations and administrative oversight related to high‐speed rail projects.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that are formed to manage or coordinate multi-agency transportation projects may need to review and adjust their governance and compliance policies to accommodate the changes in state funding limits.
