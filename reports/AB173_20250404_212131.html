                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislation requires the Secretary of Transportation to identify alternative funding for grade separation projects that lost previous funding due to budget reversions in 2024. The Transportation Agency must prioritize projects at risk of losing federal/local funding or facing schedule delays, and report to the Legislature by April 30, 2025. This change impacts local agencies that sponsor or benefit from grade separation projects, particularly cities, counties, and special districts involved in transportation infrastructure.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that had grade separation projects with funding reverted under the Budget Act of 2024 may be eligible for alternative state funding. This presents an opportunity for cities to secure replacement funding for at-risk projects, particularly those with federal matching requirements or facing schedule delays. (Deadline: April 30, 2025)
County: Counties with grade separation projects that lost funding due to the 2024 budget reversions may qualify for replacement funding. The Transportation Agency is authorized to directly allocate funds to prioritized projects, creating a pathway for counties to secure support for critical infrastructure. (Deadline: April 30, 2025)
Special District: Transportation-focused special districts (e.g., transit districts, transportation authorities) that sponsor grade separation projects affected by 2024 funding reversions may be eligible for alternative state funding. This provides an opportunity to salvage projects at risk of losing matching funds or facing delays. (Deadline: April 30, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs formed for transportation infrastructure purposes may benefit from this legislation if they oversee grade separation projects that lost funding. The direct allocation authority granted to the Transportation Agency creates a mechanism for JPAs to secure alternative funding for critical projects. (Deadline: April 30, 2025)

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This legislation expands the accountability program for the distribution of transportation funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to regional transportation planning agencies (RTPAs) through 2027-28. It creates new requirements for RTAs to submit updated regional short-term financial plans and transit operator data to the Transportation Agency to receive funding. These requirements indirectly impact local transit agencies operated by cities, counties, and special districts that receive formula-based transit funding.

                       This legislative change requires the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to compile and submit annual reports to the Legislature about its zero-emission vehicle fleet, including vehicle performance and charging infrastructure. While the reporting requirement applies specifically to Caltrans (a state agency), local agencies are indirectly impacted because they must comply with the broader Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation referenced in the existing law, which mandates transitioning local government fleets to zero-emission vehicles.

                       City: Cities are subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation mentioned in the existing law, which requires local government fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles. While this bill doesn&#39;t create new direct requirements for cities, the data collected and reported by Caltrans will likely inform future state policies affecting local agency fleet transitions.
County: Counties are subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation mentioned in the existing law, which requires local government fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles. While this bill doesn&#39;t create new direct requirements for counties, the data collected and reported by Caltrans will likely inform future state policies affecting local agency fleet transitions.
Special District: Special districts that maintain vehicle fleets are subject to the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation mentioned in the existing law. While this bill doesn&#39;t create new direct requirements for special districts, the data collected and reported by Caltrans will likely inform future state policies affecting local agency fleet transitions.

                       This legislation authorizes the Department of General Services to enter into a lease-purchase agreement or lease with option to purchase for a build-to-suit office facility to replace the DMV field office in San Francisco. While primarily affecting state agencies, there is a potential indirect impact on the City and County of San Francisco due to the mixed-use development provision that may include affordable housing.

                       This legislation expands the authority of the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General to review or investigate contract compliance of any entity receiving high-speed rail project funds. It extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees and requires future contracts (from July 1, 2024) to include provisions giving the Inspector General access to records. While primarily focused on state-level oversight, this impacts local agencies that may contract with the High-Speed Rail Authority or receive project funds.

                       This legislative change modifies the funding allocation for the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program administered by Caltrans. The change replaces the fixed 25% allocation for planning with &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning, with the remainder for implementation. This change provides more flexibility in how program funds can be distributed between planning and implementation phases of highway conversion projects.

                       City: Cities are eligible entities for this program and will be affected by the change in funding allocation. The modification provides more flexibility in the distribution of funds, potentially allowing more implementation funding if planning needs are lower than 25%. Cities partnering with Caltrans on highway conversion projects may need to adjust their grant application strategies.
County: Counties are eligible entities for this program and will be affected by the change in funding allocation. The modification provides more flexibility in the distribution of funds, potentially allowing more implementation funding if planning needs are lower than 25%. Counties partnering with Caltrans on highway conversion projects may need to adjust their grant application strategies.
Special District: Special districts (particularly transportation-related districts) may be eligible entities for this program and affected by the change in funding allocation. The modification provides more flexibility in how program funds can be distributed between planning and implementation phases.
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs formed for transportation or infrastructure projects may be eligible entities for this program and will be affected by the funding allocation change. The modification allows more implementation funding if planning needs are lower than 25%, which may affect JPA grant strategies.

                       This legislation modifies the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to allow lead applicant agencies to request letters of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This mechanism enables agencies to use their own funds for approved port infrastructure projects with the possibility of future reimbursement from program funds. The provision expires on June 30, 2033, and is repealed January 1, 2034.

                       City: Cities that operate ports or administer port-related infrastructure projects can now apply for letters of no prejudice to advance project timelines using their own funds with potential for later reimbursement from state program moneys.
County: Counties that administer port or freight infrastructure projects can utilize the letter of no prejudice mechanism to expedite project implementation using local funds while preserving eligibility for state reimbursement.
Special District: Port districts, harbor districts, and transportation-related special districts can advance approved port and freight infrastructure projects with local funding while maintaining eligibility for later state reimbursement through the letter of no prejudice process.
Joint Powers Authority: Transportation or port-related JPAs that administer eligible port and freight infrastructure projects can use the letter of no prejudice mechanism to advance projects using their own funding sources with potential for future state reimbursement.

                       This legislation increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act from 2.5% to 5%.
