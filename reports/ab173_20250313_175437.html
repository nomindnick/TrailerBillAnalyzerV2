                       This bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to collaborate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. It affects local public agencies involved in transportation projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by providing a potential source of funding for projects at risk of losing federal and local funding or facing schedule delays. These agencies are impacted as they may receive prioritized funding to continue or complete their transportation projects.

                       This bill increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century. This change affects local public agencies involved in the planning and implementation of high-speed rail projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by allowing more funds to be allocated for administrative costs. These agencies are impacted as they may need to adjust their budgeting and financial planning to accommodate the increased administrative funding cap.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation from a fixed 25% for planning and 75% for implementation to a flexible &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning, with the remainder for implementation. This affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, and joint powers authorities (JPAs) by altering how they can apply for and utilize grant funds for converting underutilized highways into multimodal corridors. These agencies are impacted as they may need to adjust their project planning and implementation strategies to align with the new funding structure.

                       This bill authorizes lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This allows them to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement, provided certain conditions are met. The affected local public agencies include those that administer or operate eligible port-related projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts. These agencies are impacted by gaining flexibility in project funding and execution, but must comply with specific conditions to secure reimbursement.
