                           The bill revises the alternative education grant funding mechanism under the local control funding formula by increasing the base grant component, modifying how average daily attendance is calculated, and introducing new grant add-ons and block grants. These changes directly affect the financing and reporting requirements for School Districts, Charter Schools, and County Offices of Education, and may indirectly impact budgeting and compliance processes at the local level. Local agencies must update internal systems and accountability plans to reflect these modifications effective with the 2023–24 fiscal year.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts will see changes in their state funding allocation due to the increased base grant and revised average daily attendance calculations, affecting internal budgeting and reporting procedures. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: Charter Schools, which receive funding through the local control formula, must adjust to the modified calculation of average daily attendance. These changes could alter funding amounts and require updates in enrollment data tracking. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education will benefit from additional funding: $200,000 add-ons for each juvenile court school and county community school operated, plus a new Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant of $3,000 per unit of average daily attendance. They will need to integrate these new grant provisions into their local control and accountability plans. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)

                           The legislation modifies funding allocations for local educational agencies in California. Starting in the 2023–24 fiscal year, the Los Angeles County Office of Education will see its add‐on funding increase from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000 for supporting statewide professional development and leadership training in antibias education and inclusive school initiatives. In addition, a new appropriation of $3,500,000 is established for county offices of education to fund the purchase and maintenance of emergency opioid antagonists for local educational agencies. As a result, while the County Office of Education is directly impacted by both funding modifications, School Districts and Charter Schools (as local educational agencies) are indirectly affected through new compliance and program implementation requirements.

                           The legislative change expands the California Prekindergarten Planning and Implementation Grant Program by authorizing the State Department of Education to use unexpended funds from grant recipients to support new purposes. These new uses include funding professional development, credential attainment, permits, and other educational expenses for preschool, transitional kindergarten, and kindergarten educators. As a result, local educational agencies—primarily School Districts and, indirectly, County Offices of Education—will need to adjust their financial management, compliance procedures, and oversight mechanisms to align with these revised funding guidelines.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts that receive grant funds must now account for the reallocation or proration of any unexpended funds to cover costs related to professional development, credential attainment, permits, and similar expenses for early childhood educators. This change requires updates to their financial tracking systems and internal policies to remain in compliance with the new state directives.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education that oversee or support local school districts may need to enhance their monitoring and technical assistance practices. This adjustment is intended to ensure that funds reallocated under the new rules are used appropriately for professional development and credentialing of early childhood educators.

                           The legislative change revises provisions under the California School Finance Authority Act governing local intercepts related to bond financing. It introduces a new mechanism whereby participating parties can request that counties, via their treasurer or designated fiscal officer, join in guaranteeing or covering bond-related payments through revenue transfers. In addition, school districts and county offices of education are now limited to intercept payments only for indebtedness where repayment is determined to be probable. These changes require local agencies to update their procedures and compliance protocols, which may affect financing strategies and board decision processes.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must now comply with a limitation that they can intercept payments only for indebtedness with a probable repayment determination. They need to review and adjust their board approval processes and financial certification criteria accordingly.
County Office of Education: County offices of education, which have been authorized to intercept payments under certain conditions, will now face the same limitation for indebtedness with probable repayment. They must ensure that financing strategies and payment interception processes are revised to meet the new standard.
County: Counties are now directly involved in the financing process. When a participating party sends a request for a local intercept, the county treasurer (or designated fiscal officer) must evaluate the request and, if the county agrees, execute an apportionment or revenue transfer. This creates a new operational duty for counties.

                           This legislative change extends the suspension of a state-mandated funds proration calculation for public education to include the 2023–24 fiscal year. Under existing law, state funds for supporting school districts, community college districts, and direct elementary/secondary instructional services were to be distributed based on specific calculations, but that requirement was already suspended for fiscal years 1992–93 through 2022–23. With this bill, school districts and community colleges will not have to apply the proration calculations for 2023–24, meaning they must revise their budgeting and financial forecasting processes accordingly.

Community College: Community colleges, which rely on state-calculated allocations, will experience the same suspension of proration calculations for fiscal year 2023–24. They must adjust their revenue projections and financial management practices to comply with the new funding framework. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)

                           The bill changes the allocation of fees collected for teacher testing by requiring that, starting July 1, 2023, all such fees be deposited directly into the Teacher Credentials Fund. It removes the existing mechanism for fee reductions when surplus funds exist and mandates that the funds be used to support the development, maintenance, and administration of tests and assessments. While the change is managed at the state level by the commission and the Department of Finance, there are indirect implications for local education agencies whose teacher recruitment, certification verification, and related budgeting processes depend on state credentialing practices.

                           The legislative change adjusts the state apportionment process for local educational agencies by mandating an additional funding allocation for school districts in the 2022–23 fiscal year. Under existing law, emergency-related declines in average daily attendance trigger corrective calculations and funding adjustments. While school districts must now receive an extra allocation equal to 12.5% of the difference computed from the 2020–21 fiscal year, charter schools and county offices of education continue to be subject to the emergency-based ADA calculations, exposing them to indirect funding impacts and potential compliance review.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: For the 2022–23 fiscal year, school districts are required to receive an additional allocation equal to 12.5% of the attendance-based funding difference calculated for the 2020–21 fiscal year. This change necessitates reviewing ADA reporting, recalculating funding differences, and submitting the appropriate documentation to the Superintendent’s office. (Deadline: July 01, 2022)
Charter School: Charter schools are part of the overall emergency ADA adjustment mechanism. Although the new 12.5% allocation explicitly applies only to school districts for the 2022–23 fiscal year, charter schools remain subject to the existing calculation methods for emergency-related attendance declines, which could indirectly affect their state apportionment amounts.
County Office of Education: County offices of education also factor into the emergency-related ADA calculations established by state law. While they are not receiving the additional percentage allocation in 2022–23, they must continue to verify attendance data and comply with documentation requirements, which may affect overall state apportionment.

                           The legislative change extends the necessary small school funding provisions—originally applicable for fiscal years 2021–22, 2022–23—to include the 2023–24 fiscal year. This means that school districts that experienced school destruction due to a state of emergency may continue to report attendance and teacher counts as if the school were operational, ensuring continuity of funding and instructional services. Local oversight agencies will also need to update their guidance to support compliance.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts that had schools destroyed by a state of emergency are now eligible to extend the necessary small school funding for 2023–24. They must continue to report the attendance generated by pupils who are attending alternative schools and count the full-time teachers who would have normally staffed the destroyed school, as if it were still operational. This change affects their funding formulas and requires updates to data collection and compliance procedures.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide guidance and support to school districts, may need to update their policies and communicate new procedures for implementing the extended funding provisions. This indirect impact ensures that school districts understand the revised reporting requirements for the 2023–24 fiscal year.

                           The legislative change broadens the purpose of the Bilingual Teacher Professional Development Program by adding an objective to increase bilingual teachers for a wider range of languages (including Spanish, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, and Arabic). It also establishes new compliance requirements by mandating quarterly meetings between the department and grant recipients, as well as revised reporting deadlines (a preliminary report due by July 1, 2026, and a final report by January 1, 2029). As these changes affect the administration, reporting, and funding procedures, eligible local educational agencies – including school districts, charter schools, and county offices of education – will need to adjust their programs to comply with the new standards.

                           The legislative change extends the deadline for using a $15,000,000 appropriation—meant to fund a repository of high-quality open educational resources—for one additional year (through 2025-06-30). This directly affects the County Office of Education (which is tasked with curating the repository) and indirectly impacts School Districts and Charter Schools that will eventually use these resources. Agencies should update their plans and budget cycles to accommodate the extended timeline.

This extension requires updated budget planning, internal timelines, and revised implementation strategies. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
School District: School Districts, as primary users of the curated repository, may experience a delay in accessing standardized, cost-effective educational resources. They need to plan for potential shifts in resource rollout schedules.
Charter School: Charter Schools, as local educational agencies that may eventually utilize the curated repository, should stay informed of development timelines and be prepared for changes that could affect resource access.

                           The legislative change revises the funding mechanism for zero‐emission schoolbus replacement and associated infrastructure. Instead of multi-year appropriations and recurring grants, the law now provides one‐time appropriations for the 2023–24 fiscal year. This shift affects local educational agencies by altering available funding levels and compliance requirements, meaning that affected agencies must update their budgeting, grant application processes, and long‐term planning.

                       School District: School Districts that own heavy‐duty internal combustion schoolbuses must now apply for a one‐time grant for zero‐emission schoolbus replacement. This change requires adjustments in budgeting, long‐term fleet replacement planning, and adherence to new application and compliance guidelines.
Charter School: Charter Schools, if recognized as local educational agencies under state law, may be eligible for these one‐time grants. They will need to review their eligibility status and potentially participate in the revised funding process for acquiring zero‐emission schoolbuses.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may need to provide oversight and coordinate support for school districts during the grant application process. The change to a one‐time funding model requires enhanced regional coordination to ensure compliance and effective use of funds for both vehicle replacement and infrastructure upgrades.

                           The legislative change revises the reporting and funding provisions for the Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialists Grant Program. It requires local educational agencies that receive grant funds—primarily School Districts, and potentially eligible Charter Schools—to submit interim reports in addition to the final report, with these reports also being forwarded to an independent evaluator. In addition, the bill restricts the use of funds for the salaries of existing literacy coaches and reading specialists and appropriates additional funds for eligible schoolsites that did not receive initial funding. These changes impose new compliance and oversight duties on local agencies, with indirect impacts on supporting bodies such as County Offices of Education.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts that qualify as recipient local educational agencies must now submit interim reports (in addition to their final report due on or before June 30, 2027) and ensure that funds are not used for existing literacy staff salaries. This also involves coordination with an independent evaluator appointed by the Superintendent. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Charter School: Charter Schools that qualify under the program may become eligible to receive augmented funds and could be subject to similar reporting requirements as School Districts. Their inclusion is indirect and depends on whether they are designated as local educational agencies under the program criteria, often via their authorizing school district.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may be indirectly impacted as they provide technical assistance and oversight support to member School Districts in complying with the revised reporting requirements and funding restrictions.

The Department of Education must publish these guidelines on its website by June 1, 2024. Local agencies adopting these practices will need to update policies, ensure compliance, and apply for funding, with potential indirect roles for regional agencies in providing technical support.

This could involve budget adjustments and the creation of protocols for compliance and effective use of the grant dollars. (Deadline: June 30, 2023)
Charter School: Charter schools, whose educators are eligible for professional learning opportunities, might need to review state guidelines and adjust internal processes to benefit from the new funding allocation. (Deadline: June 30, 2023)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may play a key role in overseeing the regional implementation of the Educator Workforce Investment Grant Program, ensuring that local agencies comply with reporting requirements and effective fund utilization. (Deadline: June 30, 2023)
Community College: While the program primarily targets K-12 educators, community colleges may indirectly benefit if state-sponsored professional learning initiatives are expanded to include their educators. They should remain alert to any state communications regarding potential inclusion.

                           The legislative change amends the Education Code to require that School Districts—acting as local educational agencies in the After School Education and Safety Program—add new contractual provisions when outsourcing before and after school programs. Specifically, any School District that contracts with a third party must ensure the contract mandates that the provider notify the district of any health or safety issues and collect pupil health information from parents or guardians.

                       School District: School Districts must review and update contracts with third-party providers operating before and after school programs to include provisions for mandatory notifications of health/safety issues and for the collection of pupil health information from parents. Although cities and counties are authorized to apply for grants under the program, the new requirement directly impacts School Districts as the contracting entity.

                           The bill revises the uniform complaint process for school districts by lowering the threshold for triggering a teacher misassignment complaint related to English learners—from a requirement based on a class having more than 20% English learner pupils to any class with at least one English learner. This change creates a state-mandated local program that imposes new procedural obligations on school districts and indirectly affects county offices of education and charter schools through oversight and related processes.

                           The bill establishes an annual appropriation of $300 million from the General Fund, starting in the 2023–24 fiscal year, to create a Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier apportionment. This change introduces a new funding mechanism that allocates additional resources to eligible local educational agencies based on each schoolsite’s prior year adjusted cumulative enrollment, with a mandated minimum of $50,000 per eligible schoolsite. It also requires the State Department of Education to report on pupil outcomes associated with this funding, thereby affecting both direct funding flows and compliance/reporting practices across local agencies.

                           The bill amends Education Code Section 33050 to prohibit the state board from waiving laws and regulations related to transitional kindergarten and kindergarten admission. This limits the flexibility that school districts and county boards of education have historically enjoyed, requiring them to comply strictly with state-established criteria without local modifications. Although the change is directed at waiver authorities, it may indirectly affect charter schools that operate under the oversight of school districts.

                       School District: School Districts will no longer be able to request waivers from the state board to modify laws or regulations related to kindergarten and transitional kindergarten admission. This change forces districts to adhere strictly to state mandates, requiring them to update their policies and procedures accordingly.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which represent county boards of education, will also be affected as they can no longer support waiver requests for kindergarten and transitional kindergarten admission. They must coordinate with school districts to implement consistent, state-mandated admission practices.

                           The legislative change amends Education Code Section 52065, imposing new posting requirements for Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAPs) on school district and county office of education websites. School district superintendents must now post LCAPs approved by both the school district governing board and the county superintendent, while county superintendents must post LCAPs approved by the county board of education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. This creates a state-mandated local program that affects compliance processes and website management for the involved local agencies.

County Office of Education: County superintendents must update the county office website to post LCAPs approved by the county board of education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. This increases the compliance burden and requires updated procedures for timely and accurate posting.

                           The legislative change extends an existing requirement for county superintendents of schools by mandating that even those with jurisdiction over a single school district must annually prepare, present, and submit a summary outlining how they will support school districts in implementing their Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAPs). This creates a new state-mandated local program that increases administrative and compliance burdens at the county level, with indirect implications for school districts as they coordinate with their county offices of education.

                       County Office of Education: County superintendents in counties with a single school district, previously exempt, must now develop and present an annual summary to the county board of education and file it with the LCAP. This change introduces new reporting and oversight duties that may require adjustments in personnel, internal processes, and resource allocation.
School District: While the new requirements are directed at county superintendents, school districts may experience indirect impacts through enhanced oversight, modified support processes, and closer coordination with county offices of education regarding LCAP implementation.

                           The legislative change mandates extended and additional technical assistance protocols for school districts based on performance criteria and data submission compliance. Specifically, county superintendents (operating within County Offices of Education) must provide technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years for districts with certain pupil subgroup performance issues, and also for districts that fail to submit required data. Additionally, if a school district meets these performance criteria for 3 or more consecutive years, its geographic lead agency must collaborate with the county superintendent to provide continued technical assistance. This creates a state-mandated local program that will affect operational procedures and compliance requirements for the impacted local agencies.
                       
                    </p>

                       School District: School districts triggering the performance or data submission criteria will be subject to mandatory, multi-year technical assistance. They must also engage and coordinate with their geographic lead agency if the performance issues persist for 3 or more consecutive years.
County Office of Education: County superintendents are now required to provide technical assistance for a minimum of 2 years for any school district with designated performance issues or failure to submit required data. In cases where a school district meets performance criteria for 3+ consecutive years, they must also collaborate with the school district’s geographic lead agency.

                           This legislative change mandates that the California Superintendent of Public Instruction provide extended technical assistance—specifically, a minimum two‐year period—for any county office of education that either has one or more specified pupil subgroups meeting certain performance criteria or fails to submit required data. Although the change primarily targets county offices of education, school districts may be indirectly affected through adjustments in the LCAP (Local Control and Accountability Plan) review and revision process.

                       County Office of Education: County offices of education that meet the specified performance criteria or that fail to submit required data will now trigger a mandatory technical assistance period of at least two years. This change will likely require these agencies to revise their data submission processes and adjust LCAP-related planning and review procedures.
School District: While not directly addressed, school districts may be indirectly impacted because changes in the technical assistance process for county offices of education could lead to more rigorous oversight and potential revisions in the LCAP submission and approval process at the district level.

                           The legislative change revises intervention provisions for underperforming school agencies by establishing two distinct processes. It requires the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to first provide technical assistance and determine the need for further action, and then authorizes the Superintendent—subject to state board approval—to intervene in school districts and county offices of education that fail to meet performance benchmarks. Although the primary impacts target school districts and county offices of education, charter schools are also indirectly affected through enhanced advisory services.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must actively collaborate with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence and technical assistance providers to evaluate performance based on a specified rubric over three out of four consecutive school years. Failure to implement recommendations may trigger state intervention, requiring mandated revisions to the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) as well as the development and imposition of a budget revision.
County Office of Education: County offices of education are now required to work in consultation with the CA Collaborative for Educational Excellence to assess performance. Persistent underperformance or failure to implement recommendations according to a specified rubric may lead to state intervention, with corresponding requirements for LCAP and budget revisions.
Charter School: Charter schools, while not directly subject to the intervention process detailed for school districts and county offices of education, are included under the mandate of the CA Collaborative for Educational Excellence. They may receive advisory services to help align their Local Control and Accountability Plans with state performance goals.

                           The legislative change updates the existing Community Engagement Initiative Expansion by adding a requirement that all partnerships under the initiative provide fiscal support to partner organizations. This change is intended to build capacity for meaningful collaboration and may affect local public agencies involved in community engagement, primarily in the education sector. Local agencies such as School Districts and County Offices of Education, and indirectly Charter Schools, will need to review and adjust their partnership agreements, budgeting, and operational procedures to comply with the new fiscal support mandate.

                       School District: School districts that are participants in the Community Engagement Initiative must update their partnership agreements and budgeting processes to incorporate mandatory fiscal support for partner organizations. This change requires a reassessment of existing funds and potentially new financial strategies during the 2022–23 fiscal year onward. (Deadline: July 01, 2022)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which may serve as lead agencies or provide oversight to local school districts, must develop strategies and processes to implement the new fiscal support requirement as part of the community engagement professional learning networks. (Deadline: July 01, 2022)
Charter School: Although not directly addressed, Charter Schools—often operating under the purview of or in partnership with school districts—may be indirectly impacted by changes in community engagement protocols and fiscal support mechanisms.

                           The legislative change creates a new state‐mandated program requiring local educational agencies serving kindergarten, grade 1, and grade 2 to adopt a state‐approved screening instrument for assessing reading difficulties and dyslexia. Local agencies must implement annual screening and provide support services for students at risk. This mandate imposes compliance and program implementation requirements with specific deadlines for instrument adoption, while also indirectly affecting oversight bodies.
                       
                    </p>

                       School District: School Districts serving pupils in K-2 must adopt one or more state-approved screening instruments by June 30, 2025 and begin annual assessments from the 2025–26 school year. They are additionally required to deliver supports and services to any pupil identified at risk for reading difficulties. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
Charter School: Charter Schools that serve pupils in kindergarten through grade 2 must comply with the mandate by adopting a screening instrument from the state-approved list by June 30, 2025 and implementing annual assessments with requisite support services. (Deadline: June 30, 2025)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, while not directly mandated to conduct screenings, may need to offer guidance, oversight, and coordination to School Districts and Charter Schools as they implement the new screening program.

                           The legislative change updates the requirements for the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CalPADS) by mandating that local educational agencies, primarily school districts, submit pupil data—including individual test records—in accordance with new processes and timelines established by the state Department of Education. This creates a state-mandated local program that imposes additional compliance and operational duties on affected agencies, with indirect impacts on entities such as charter schools and county offices of education.

                       School District: Must submit detailed student data and individual test records per the new department-established processes and timelines. This change requires updating internal procedures, IT systems, and record retention policies to meet both state and federal requirements.
Charter School: If operating under a local educational agency framework, charter schools may need to align with the new data submission protocols and retention requirements, particularly when coordinated with their authorizing school districts.
County Office of Education: Likely to be involved in supporting and monitoring school districts’ transition to the new CalPADS data submission requirements, including providing technical support and ensuring regional compliance.

                           The Budget Act of 2023 appropriates approximately $118.81 million for the federal Stronger Connections Grant Program, requiring the Superintendent of Public Instruction to competitively award grants to eligible local educational agencies. This funding is designated to support the implementation of Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) that promote safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments through integrated academic, behavioral, and social-emotional practices. Local public agencies must now adhere to new grant application procedures and compliance requirements tied to federal and state guidelines.
                       
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts are directly impacted as they are eligible to receive competitive grant funds under the Stronger Connections Grant Program. They must implement MTSS activities to create safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments by integrating academic, behavioral, and social-emotional support practices, and comply with both federal and state funding requirements.
Charter School: Charter Schools may be indirectly impacted if they qualify or partner with School Districts under the grant process. They will need to review their alignment with MTSS initiatives and adjust policies to ensure that they are in step with the new requirements aimed at enhancing integrated academic, behavioral, and social-emotional supports.

                           The new bill mandates that the Legislative Analyst’s Office provide, by March 15, 2024, recommendations for revising the local control and accountability plan used by county offices of education. Additionally, county boards must file these plans within five days of adoption or update, and the Superintendent may later request additional clarifications. These changes introduce new reporting and oversight requirements that could alter current compliance and operational processes at the county level, with possible downstream impacts on related local educational agencies.

                           The bill directs the Superintendent of Public Instruction to allocate funding for the Diverse Education Leaders Pipeline Initiative, which provides grants to local educational agencies for training, placing, and retaining diverse and culturally responsive administrators in transitional K-12. Local agencies receiving these funds must implement new procedures including candidate agreements that mandate a minimum 2‐year service commitment, and update internal policies to ensure compliance with the program’s requirements. The Commission on Teacher Credentialing is also required to report on the program by June 30, 2027, which may indirectly impact local agencies as they prepare to participate and monitor outcomes.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts are eligible to receive grants (up to $30,000 per administrator candidate) to support initiatives for training, placement, and retention of diverse administrators. They must implement written agreements with candidates requiring at least two school years of service and update hiring/training policies accordingly.
Charter School: If classified as a local educational agency under applicable guidelines, Charter Schools may receive grant funding. They would need to review and adjust their policies to ensure that any grant-funded administrator candidate commits to a minimum two-year service term.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may play a supportive role by advising and coordinating with School Districts and Charter Schools on compliance, application procedures, and best practices for implementing the grant-funded initiative.

                           The legislative change extends the period during which appropriated funds under the California Preschool, Transitional Kindergarten, and Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program are available for encumbrance or expenditure. This extension requires School Districts to reexamine their facility construction or retrofit project timelines and budgeting processes. Additionally, County Offices of Education may experience an indirect impact as they coordinate and advise school districts on adapting to the extended funding periods.

                           The bill increases state appropriations for school construction and modernization projects under the Leroy F. Green School Facilities Act, expanding funding for the upcoming 2023–24 fiscal year and allowing for administrative cost charges. This change provides enhanced funding opportunities for local educational agencies while imposing new compliance and project review requirements that filter down from state-level guidelines.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts will receive increased state funding for new construction and modernization of school facilities, requiring them to adjust project proposals, adhere to revised administrative cost limits, and comply with updated guidelines issued by the State Allocation Board and the Department of General Services. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: Charter Schools, often operating under or in partnership with local School Districts, may indirectly benefit from expanded funding for facility projects. They must work closely with their authorizers to verify eligibility and comply with any revised project funding requirements.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may need to provide additional oversight and support to local School Districts as they navigate the new funding and compliance requirements for construction and modernization projects.

                           The legislative change reduces the appropriation for the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund by $1,590,595,000—from approximately $7.94 billion to $6.35 billion—and adjusts reporting deadlines for local educational agencies receiving these funds. Affected agencies include those directly allocated funds (School Districts, County Offices of Education, and Charter Schools) and, indirectly, Community Colleges. Agencies will need to review and update their budgeting, reporting systems, and compliance procedures to accommodate the new interim (starting December 15, 2024, and annually thereafter) and final (December 15, 2029) reporting deadlines.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts will receive a reduced allocation from the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund and must adhere to new reporting deadlines: an interim report by December 15, 2024 (with subsequent annual reports) and a final report by December 15, 2029. They should adjust internal budgeting and reporting systems accordingly. (Deadline: December 15, 2024)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education will be affected by the overall reduction in appropriations, with new reporting deadlines requiring an interim submission by December 15, 2024 (and annually thereafter) and a final report by December 15, 2029. They must update their data collection and compliance procedures. (Deadline: December 15, 2024)
Charter School: Charter Schools receiving allocations from the fund must adjust to the reduced funding and comply with the revised reporting deadlines. This entails updating their compliance systems and financial planning to meet the new interim (starting December 15, 2024, and annually thereafter) and final (December 15, 2029) reporting requirements. (Deadline: December 15, 2024)
Community College: Community Colleges, which may be eligible for allocations under the original fund structure, could experience indirect effects from the reduced appropriation. While specific reporting requirements may not be as clearly defined as for K-12 agencies, these institutions should monitor any changes in fund distribution and potential future reporting adjustments.

                           The legislative change removes a state requirement that the Controller’s audit guide include instructions for detecting unspent funds in projects under the Charter School Facilities Program, Career Technical Education Facilities Program, and hardship-funded projects. This removal means that local educational agencies will no longer receive explicit state guidance on auditing these funds, potentially requiring them to adjust their internal controls and compliance processes.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts receiving funds under the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act will lose the benefit of state-issued audit procedures for identifying unspent funds in facilities projects. They may need to revise their internal auditing and financial control processes to ensure that all funds are properly accounted for.
Charter School: Charter schools involved in facilities projects under the Charter School Facilities Program will be indirectly impacted. Without state audit guide instructions, these schools must implement or enhance their internal oversight to manage and monitor unspent project funds.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide oversight and support to multiple local educational agencies, may need to develop new guidance and training to help school districts and charter schools adjust to the absence of state audit instructions.

                           This legislative change removes the eligibility for transportation funding and its associated planning obligations from school districts that secure an approved districtwide charter petition. In effect, if a school district converts all its schools to charter status, it will no longer receive the 60% transportation allowance nor be required to develop a detailed transportation service plan targeting early grades and low-income pupils. The change also indirectly affects charter schools that emerge from such conversions and county offices that oversee these districts.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts that obtain an approved districtwide charter petition will lose the transportation allowance and the mandate to develop a transportation services plan. This requires districts to reassess the benefits of charter conversion against the loss of state transportation funding and related compliance responsibilities.
Charter School: Charter schools resulting from a full district conversion will not be eligible for the transportation allowance. This may necessitate the development of alternative funding strategies for pupil transportation services.
County Office of Education: County offices that oversee school districts impacted by this change may need to adjust funding allocation formulas and oversight practices related to pupil transportation services, as changes at the school district level will cascade to county-level administration.

                           This legislative change revises the provisions governing educator assignment data and monitoring, expanding the Commission on Teacher Credentialing’s authority and altering local educational agency oversight. Local agencies must now work with a state-mandated data system to track a broader range of educator assignments (including those filled by individuals on preliminary, intern credentials, permits, or waivers) and face potential sanctions if they consistently misassign educators. Additionally, county superintendents and local agencies must adjust their annual reporting and inspection processes. Although the deadlines initially target the commission’s review processes, the resulting recommendations and regulatory changes will impact compliance, reporting, and staffing practices within local agencies.

Charter School: Charter schools, as local educational agencies, are required to comply with new oversight mechanisms. They must track educator assignments with an emphasis on credential levels and ensure access to published accountability data, exposing them to potential sanctions if misassignments are recurrent.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education will play a coordinating role with county superintendents to enforce the new reporting and inspection requirements. This includes facilitating the data sharing process and supporting annual school inspections to assess compliance regarding teacher credential levels.

                           The bill revises teacher credentialing procedures by adding two main provisions. First, it requires the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to issue a comparable preliminary credential to eligible military service members, their spouses/domestic partners, or surviving spouses/domestic partners based on a valid, out‑of‑state, professional-level credential, with validity tied to the duration of military orders. Second, it exempts specified preliminary multiple subject and single subject credential candidates from having to complete the teaching performance assessment. Although the Commission is the primary state agency affected, these changes filter down to local educational agencies by influencing hiring practices, credential verification, and teacher preparation program requirements.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must update hiring policies to recognize and verify comparable credentials issued to eligible military-related applicants, ensuring that these credentials, which are limited to the duration of active military orders, are monitored for timely renewal or conversion.
Charter School: Charter schools will need to adjust their recruitment and credential verification processes to acknowledge the new comparable credentials and exemptions from the teaching performance assessment, ensuring compliance with state education code changes.
County Office of Education: County offices, which support and oversee school districts and charter schools, must develop clear advisory materials and guidance regarding the new military-related credential provisions and the exemption from teaching performance assessments.
Community College: Community colleges that run teacher preparation programs could be indirectly impacted as the exemption from the teaching performance assessment may necessitate curriculum reviews and adjustments regarding preparation standards for preliminary credentials.

                           The legislative change revises the Teacher Residency Grant Program by broadening the service requirement for residency candidates from serving only in the sponsoring agency&#39;s jurisdiction to serving in any public school in California. It increases the grant amount from $25,000 to $40,000 per candidate, mandates that for awards starting with the 2023–24 fiscal year recipients must provide a minimum compensation package of at least $20,000, and extends the evaluation report deadline to December 1, 2029. These modifications affect teacher recruitment, placement policies, and compensation standards, which will have both direct and indirect impacts on local agencies.

                       School District: Residency candidates are no longer required to serve solely within the sponsoring district, allowing them to work in any public school in California. School Districts will need to adjust teacher placement policies and coordinate with other districts since traditional localized recruitment may be disrupted.
Charter School: With the expanded service requirement, charter schools may attract residency candidates who previously were limited by geographic constraints. Charter Schools will need to review their hiring and compensation practices to align with the new minimum compensation package requirement.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which serve as regional support entities, may need to oversee the broader distribution of residency candidates across county boundaries and work with multiple districts to ensure that the new service and compensation requirements are met.

                           The legislative change refines licensing requirements and adjusts funding expenditure timelines for the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program. It establishes a process and timeline for local educational agencies contracting with third-party providers and mandates additional data reporting. School Districts and Charter Schools are directly impacted, while County Offices of Education may be indirectly affected as resource and referral agencies.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must comply with new licensing requirements based on whether they operate the program themselves or through third-party providers, and they must adjust their funding expenditure plans to align with the extended fiscal deadlines.
Charter School: Charter schools authorized to operate expanded learning programs must adhere to updated licensing rules when contracting with third parties and modify their expenditure schedules in line with the new funding timeline.
County Office of Education: County offices may be indirectly impacted by their role as resource and referral agencies, as they could be responsible for managing and disseminating compiled data from state agencies.

Specifically, it postpones the staffing ratio requirement until the 2025–26 school year, extends the teacher qualification deadline to August 1, 2025, and introduces new enrollment rules for early enrollment children—including requirements to offer concurrent state preschool enrollment if available—as well as enhanced reporting obligations to the State Department of Education for the 2023–24 and 2024–25 school years.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must adjust their transitional kindergarten programs by delaying the adult-to-pupil ratio requirement until the 2025–26 school year, extending teacher qualification compliance to August 1, 2025, and implementing new enrollment rules for early enrollment children. They are also required to report enrollment data to the State Department of Education as set by the new deadlines.
Charter School: Charter schools are subject to the same transitional kindergarten program changes as school districts, including a delayed staffing ratio requirement, extended deadlines for teacher qualifications, new provisions for enrolling early enrollment children (with associated attendance restrictions), and mandatory reporting requirements.

                           The bill revises the Charter Schools Act by modifying the appeal process for charter petition denials, extending the mandatory renewal terms for existing charter schools, and prolonging the prohibition on approving new nonclassroom‐based charter schools.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts that serve as chartering authorities must update their appeal procedures to ensure that denials of charter petitions are reviewed for abuse of discretion at both the district and county board levels. They must also manage revised processes for renewing charter petitions with extended term requirements.
County Office of Education: County offices of education acting as chartering authorities need to implement the enhanced review processes for charter petition appeals and manage the new renewal guidelines for charter schools. They are additionally required to collaborate in producing a report on funding processes for nonclassroom‐based charter schools. (Deadline: March 01, 2024)
Charter School: Charter schools are directly impacted by the mandatory term extension provisions; those with terms expiring between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2025 receive a 2-year extension, while schools with terms expiring between January 1, 2024 and June 30, 2027 must also receive an additional 1-year extension. They must also navigate the changes in the appeals process for petition denials.
County: County-level agencies, particularly the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, are mandated to produce a report detailing the processes used in determining funding for nonclassroom‐based charter schools, thereby affecting county fiscal oversight mechanisms. (Deadline: March 01, 2024)

                           The bill revises existing law governing juvenile court schools by mandating that memoranda of understanding (MOUs) include a joint intake evaluation process completed within 2 business days (or up to 5 under extraordinary circumstances) once a ward enters a juvenile facility and requires a transition plan to be transferred within 2 business days upon reenrollment at a local educational agency. In addition, the department must report annually on juvenile pupil outcomes, contract an independent evaluation of county juvenile court and community schools (due by November 1, 2025), and convene a workgroup to review services for pupils with disabilities (report due by February 25, 2025). These changes impose new operational, reporting, and collaborative requirements that filter down to various local public agencies.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts that serve as the postplacement local educational agency must process transition plans and student records rapidly (within 2 business days) once a ward reenrolls, ensuring compliance with the mandated timelines for intake evaluations and transitions.
County Office of Education: County offices of education, which operate juvenile court schools and community schools, must update MOUs to include a joint intake evaluation process with strict business day deadlines, coordinate with county probation departments, and convene a workgroup to address the educational needs of pupils with disabilities.
Charter School: Charter schools receiving reenrolled wards must set up processes to accept and process transition plans within the required 2 business days, aligning with the new state mandates on student record transfers.
County: County-level agencies, including county probation departments, must revise existing practices to collaborate with county offices of education and partner with postsecondary institutions (California Community Colleges, CSU, and optionally UC) for outreach and educational programming, including for those detained in secure youth treatment facilities.
Community College: Community colleges, as potential partners under the new requirements for providing public postsecondary academic and career technical courses, may need to adjust course schedules and eligibility criteria to facilitate the education of detained juveniles in collaboration with county probation departments.

                           The new legislation directs $3,500,000 from the General Fund to the State Department of Education for allocation to county offices of education. Funds are to be used to purchase and maintain a minimum of two emergency opioid antagonist units at each middle, junior, high, and adult school site in school districts and charter schools. This creates new program coordination, funding management, and compliance requirements that impact county offices of education directly, and school districts and charter schools indirectly.

                       County Office of Education: County Offices of Education must coordinate the statewide purchase and maintenance of emergency opioid antagonist units at designated school sites. They will manage the allocated funds—including up to $350,000 for administrative costs—and ensure that their jurisdictions (covering school districts and charter schools) meet the new emergency preparedness requirements starting in the 2023–24 fiscal year. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
School District: School Districts are required to ensure that each middle, junior, high, and adult school site maintains a minimum stock of two emergency opioid antagonist units. While the funding and coordination are managed by the county offices of education, school districts must implement and monitor the emergency preparedness protocols and support the training of designated personnel. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)
Charter School: Charter Schools, falling under the jurisdiction of county offices of education, must comply by maintaining a minimum of two opioid antagonist units at each applicable school site. Compliance with the new emergency preparedness standards is essential to benefit from the state funding allocations. (Deadline: July 01, 2023)

                           The legislative change shifts the reimbursement process for school meal programs. Instead of reimbursing local educational agencies for nonreimbursed USDA expenses, the State Department of Education will now provide state meal reimbursement to qualifying school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools for reduced‐price and paid meals. Affected agencies must now meet federal program requirements as well as applicable state laws to secure funding, requiring updates in administrative procedures, financial planning, and compliance practices.

This change calls for updated recordkeeping, documentation, and budgeting to account for reimbursement for both reduced-price and paid meals. (Deadline: August 01, 2022)
County Office of Education: County offices of education are now directly responsible for obtaining state meal reimbursements. They must ensure compliance with federal meal program standards and state regulations, potentially requiring revisions in administrative and financial management to support the expanded reimbursement scope. (Deadline: August 01, 2022)
Charter School: Charter schools are newly included among eligible agencies for state meal reimbursements. They must now adhere to the relevant federal and state requirements to secure funding for reduced-price and paid meals and may need to adjust internal processes to document compliance.

                           The bill mandates that the Student Aid Commission provide discrete data to the California College Guidance Initiative so that educator reports can verify if each pupil has submitted their Free Application for Federal Student Aid or California Dream Act Application. This change directly impacts local educational agencies—specifically School Districts, County Offices of Education, and Charter Schools—by requiring them to update internal data tracking, compliance, and oversight procedures to effectively use the new reporting system.

                       School District: School Districts must adjust their internal processes to review and act on the educator reports supplied via the designated website, ensuring every pupil’s financial aid application is completed and submitted. This may involve enhancing data collection methods and coordination with state-level initiatives.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education need to collaborate with the Student Aid Commission and the California College Guidance Initiative to utilize the discrete data for monitoring application submissions across school districts, adjusting oversight practices accordingly.
Charter School: As defined under local educational agency, Charter Schools must ensure that their process for monitoring financial aid application submissions aligns with the new educator reports, potentially requiring revisions in internal monitoring systems.

                           The legislative change revises the requirements for local control and accountability plans (LCAPs) by mandating an updated state-adopted template. The new template requires local agencies to include a detailed summary of the stakeholder engagement process—specifically identifying stakeholders at schools receiving Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier funding—and to incorporate new instructions for remedial actions when a school or pupil group scores at the lowest performance level on state indicators. This state-mandated local program affects the preparation and content of LCAPs for School Districts, Charter Schools, and County Offices of Education, with compliance expected to commence with the 2024–25 planning cycle.

                           The legislative change imposes additional reporting and presentation requirements on local education agencies. County Offices of Education must now incorporate detailed, separate reporting on add‐on funding for juvenile court schools, county community schools, and the Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant into their local control funding formula budget overview. In addition, charter schools and school districts (through their superintendents) are required to present an annual report on the update to the local control and accountability plan (LCAP) and the funding overview to their governing bodies or advisory committees on or before February 28. This creates new state-mandated local programs and additional compliance obligations.

                       County Office of Education: County Offices of Education must update the local control funding formula budget overview to separately address add-on funding sources (for juvenile court schools, county community schools, and the Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant). They are also required to ensure that a report encompassing the LCAP update and these financial details is presented to the county board/advisory committee by the February 28 deadline. (Deadline: February 28, 2024)
Charter School: Charter schools must prepare and present an annual report that combines the update to the LCAP with the local control funding formula budget overview for parents. This presentation must occur at a regularly scheduled governing body meeting by February 28, adding to their existing public hearing and reporting obligations. (Deadline: February 28, 2024)
School District: School districts must have their superintendents prepare and present a report on the annual update to the LCAP along with the local control funding formula budget overview for parents. This report is to be presented at a regularly scheduled governing board meeting (or to applicable advisory committees including both parent and English learner parent advisory committees) on or before February 28, thus expanding prior review-only protocols.

                           The bill amends California&#39;s public school accountability system by mandating that local educational agencies separately measure the performance of English learners and long-term English learners. This change requires updates to evaluation rubrics, data collection systems, and reporting processes in school districts, charter schools, and county offices of education, thereby imposing new state-mandated local program duties.

                           The bill mandates that performance data on state and local indicators be publicly reported via the California School Dashboard by specified deadlines for the prior school year. This change requires updates to data collection timelines through the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System and imposes new compliance and reporting duties on local educational agencies, thereby creating a state-mandated local program.

                           The legislative change requires the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, in coordination with the State Department of Education, to select local educational agencies to serve as Equity Leads by March 1, 2024. These Equity Leads—drawn from School Districts, Charter Schools, County Offices of Education, or a consortium of local educational agencies (potentially structured as a Joint Powers Authority)—will assume new responsibilities to develop and disseminate resources, analyze programs, and implement actions to address racial disparities. In addition, these agencies must support other local agencies (with priority to those receiving Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier funding) and prepare to manage newly appropriated funds starting in fiscal year 2023–24.

(Deadline: March 01, 2024)
Charter School: Charter Schools may be selected as Equity Leads and will need to demonstrate the capacity to craft and share best practices for program analysis and to address racial disparities. They must align their administrative functions to meet these new state-mandated equity initiatives. (Deadline: March 01, 2024)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education can be chosen as Equity Leads and will be responsible for devising strategies and resources to support local educational agencies. They must emphasize support for agencies with LCFF Equity Multiplier funding and coordinate with state authorities to access new funding streams. (Deadline: March 01, 2024)
Joint Powers Authority: If local educational agencies opt to form a consortium to serve as a single Equity Lead, the resulting Joint Powers Authority will assume collective responsibility for meeting the new equity mandates, including resource development and support services, through a competitive selection process. (Deadline: March 01, 2024)

                           The legislative change revises how local education agencies access and fund technical assistance from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. Previously, any school district, county office of education, or charter school could request such advice and then reimburse the Collaborative under the annual Budget Act. Under the new bill, only those that meet specific technical assistance eligibility criteria may request assistance, and a new provision authorizes the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (a function within county operations) to request these services – with an associated requirement to reimburse the Collaborative. Agencies will need to review their eligibility status, update internal procedures for service requests, and adjust reimbursement protocols to ensure compliance.

                       School District: School districts must now verify that they are eligible for certain technical assistance before requesting advice from the Collaborative. If eligible and a request is made, they remain obligated to reimburse the costs based on the annual Budget Act.
County Office of Education: County offices are subject to the new eligibility criteria and, additionally, the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team (a county-level function) is now authorized to request technical assistance. Both must ensure proper reimbursement of costs as stipulated under the annual Budget Act.
Charter School: Charter schools now must meet specific technical assistance eligibility requirements before they can access advice and assistance from the Collaborative, and they must reimburse the Collaborative for the services provided, in line with the annual Budget Act.

                           The legislative change clarifies and extends the intended use of interim assessments provided by the department to local educational agencies. Previously, such assessments were designed solely for providing feedback to improve instruction, support communication with parents, and help identify teacher professional development needs – and their results could not be used for high-stakes decisions such as teacher evaluations or student promotion/retention. With the amendment, these purposes and prohibitions now apply universally to any interim assessments offered to local educational agencies. Local public agencies must review and update their assessment and evaluation policies to ensure these tools are used only for formative, instructional improvement purposes.

They must avoid using these assessments for high-stakes decisions like teacher evaluations or decisions regarding student promotion and retention.
Charter School: Charter schools, as local educational agencies receiving these assessments, are required to revise their protocols, ensuring assessment results are not misused for high-stakes decisions. They must align their practices with the state mandate to use interim assessments strictly for feedback and instructional support.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, while not directly administering assessments, are likely to play an oversight role. They must provide guidance and support to school districts and charter schools in interpreting and implementing the new restrictions on the use of interim assessments.

                           The legislative change broadens the scope of the California College Guidance Initiative (CCGI) by expanding its services from only California school districts to include all local educational agencies. It also revises the department’s notification duties under FERPA by requiring local agencies to update their annual parent notifications to include information on the additional use of CalPADS and CCGI data. This change creates new compliance and operational requirements for agencies that were not previously eligible and impacts their data notification processes.

                       School District: School Districts must revise their annual parent notifications to include detailed information regarding the use of CalPADS and CCGI data. This requires internal reviews and updates to compliance protocols as they adjust to receiving expanded services under CCGI.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, now recognized as local educational agencies eligible for CCGI services, are required to update their notification practices regarding the additional use of CalPADS data. They must implement processes to ensure that notifications meet the revised FERPA-based obligations.
Charter School: Charter Schools are newly included as recipients of CCGI services. They must amend their annual parent notifications to incorporate the new data usage disclosures related to CalPADS and CCGI, and adjust internal procedures to comply with the updated requirements.

                           The legislative change reduces state funding for certain charter schools in the 2022–23 fiscal year from $413,000,000 to $290,023,000 – a cut of approximately $122,977,000. This change directly affects Charter School agencies by reducing available funds and indirectly impacts School Districts and County Offices of Education that authorize or support these charter schools. Affected agencies must review budgets, adjust operations, and identify supplemental funding to mitigate adverse effects.

                       Charter School: The appropriation for charter schools is reduced by roughly $123M for the 2022–23 fiscal year, which may force charter schools to cut programs, reallocate resources, or seek alternative funding sources. (Deadline: July 01, 2022)
School District: Since charter schools operate under a charter with local school districts, reduced funding may lead districts to reexamine their oversight policies and budget expectations related to charter operations.

                           The legislative change revises the eligibility criteria for state funds allocated for kitchen infrastructure upgrades and school meal program enhancements. It updates the list of approved school food best practices and narrows the definition of &#39;freshly prepared onsite meals.&#39; The State Department of Education is now empowered to interpret the revised definition and issue guidance, which will filter down to local educational agencies. Affected agencies must review and adjust their funding plans, operational protocols, and procurement practices to align with the new requirements.

                       School District: School Districts, as local educational agencies, are eligible for a portion of the $600 million appropriation for kitchen infrastructure upgrades and must adhere to the revised best practices for school meal programs. They need to update internal spending plans and ensure compliance with the revised eligibility criteria and definitions.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, responsible for supporting and advising school districts within their jurisdictions, must update their oversight protocols to align with the revised criteria. They are tasked with ensuring that the funds allocated for kitchen upgrades and school food best practices are properly administered in consultation with the State Department of Education and the Department of Food and Agriculture.
Charter School: Charter Schools, which are directly eligible for the appropriated funds, must realign their operational policies concerning meal services. They need to integrate the revised definition of &#39;freshly prepared onsite meals&#39; and update their procurement and food service practices accordingly.

                           The legislative change reduces the Arts, Music, and Instructional Materials Discretionary Block Grant for the 2022–23 fiscal year by $200 million—from $3,560,885,000 to $3,360,885,000. This appropriation adjustment impacts local agencies that receive and allocate these funds, specifically school districts, charter schools, and county offices of education. These agencies will need to review their budget plans, update fund distribution methodologies, and adjust program spending to align with the new, lower funding level.

County Office of Education: County offices of education, responsible for distributing these funds to local agencies, will need to reexamine their allocation formulas and ensure that the reduced funding is properly distributed.

                           The bill appropriates $1,000,000 to the State Department of Education to develop a Literacy Roadmap designed to assist educators in applying the state’s curriculum framework to classroom instruction and professional development. Although the initiative is state-led, it has potential direct and indirect impacts on local education agencies by introducing new guidelines and programs that may require local policy adjustments and staff training to meet enhanced literacy and equity goals.

                       School District: School Districts may need to review and adjust their curriculum frameworks and professional development programs in order to align with the new Literacy Roadmap. This could involve forming committees, revising instructional policies, and coordinating new training initiatives for educators.
Charter School: Charter Schools, which operate under local school districts, could be indirectly impacted by this state initiative. These schools may be required to integrate the new literacy guidelines into their instructional practices and professional development activities.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education are expected to play a supportive role by helping school districts and charter schools implement the Literacy Roadmap. This may include organizing regional training sessions and facilitating communication between state and local agencies.

This update must be undertaken in consultation with state education authorities to ensure alignment with the state-adopted mathematics framework.
School District: As the updated curriculum and instructional guidance are developed by the County Office of Education, local School Districts will eventually need to review and adopt these changes to ensure their distance learning programs align with the new math framework.
Charter School: Charter Schools operating within the area may be required to modify their instructional programs to comply with the updated distance learning guidelines once they are issued by the County Office of Education.

                           The bill appropriates $100,000 for the 2023–24 fiscal year to extend the evaluation of technical assistance provided under certain Education Code sections. By contracting an independent evaluator to analyze processes—using, for example, data from the California School Dashboard—the state seeks to assess and potentially revise technical assistance protocols. Although local agencies are not the primary target, the resulting evaluation could lead to changes in guidelines and compliance procedures that affect them indirectly.

Charter School: Charter schools, which operate under the oversight of authorizing districts and county offices, may experience changes in the technical assistance framework that affect operational and compliance aspects.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, responsible for supporting and monitoring school districts and charter schools, might need to revise oversight procedures and guidance in response to updated technical assistance practices informed by the evaluation.

They may be required to participate in training, submit applications for support, and meet periodic reporting and evaluation requirements under the new grant program.
Charter School: Charter schools, particularly those that are classroom-based and qualify as local educational agencies, may access support through the grant program. They will need to align their instructional and support frameworks with the integrated approach and comply with any grant-related conditions.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, which provide regional support to school districts, may play a key role in coordinating the implementation of integrated practices. They could be responsible for monitoring district compliance and providing technical assistance.

                           The legislative change revises wage overpayment recovery requirements for school employers by mandating written notification of overpayments that includes detailed employee rights, prohibiting full payroll deductions for overpayments older than one year, and requiring that any disputes about overpayment amounts be resolved via legal action or binding arbitration. In cases where a memorandum of understanding was in effect on July 31, 2022, its terms control until renewed or expired. Local educational agencies must update their administrative and payroll procedures and review existing MOUs to ensure compliance.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts must revise their payroll and HR protocols to provide written notification of wage overpayments, adhere to revised deduction limits (eliminating full payroll deductions for overpayments older than one year) and proceed with legal or arbitration processes if an employee disputes an overpayment. They are also required to review and account for any active memoranda of understanding from before July 31, 2022.
Charter School: Charter schools, as independent educational employers, are equally required to update their notification and recoupment procedures for wage overpayments. This includes implementing the new written notice requirement, modifying repayment methods, and ensuring disputes are resolved through appropriate legal processes. They must also verify their standing MOUs to determine if they preempt the new provisions.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, though not always the direct employer of school staff, may need to offer guidance and oversight to local school districts and charter schools regarding the changes. They might also be involved in interpreting the implications of existing MOUs and assisting in statewide compliance efforts.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts must update their exemption procedures so that only students entering 9th grade in the 2022–23 school year or later are exempt from additional local course requirements, and modify their eligibility criteria for alternative diploma pathways accordingly.
Charter School: As local educational agencies, Charter Schools are required to align their policies with the new state standards, ensuring that exemptions are only applied to the eligible cohort and that alternative diploma pathways are properly adjusted.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education may need to provide updated guidance to School Districts and Charter Schools, ensuring consistency in policy implementation and monitoring compliance with the revised exemption and diploma pathway criteria.

                           The legislative change extends the prohibition on school districts from electing to submit a consolidated special education local plan area until July 1, 2026, while also mandating increased transparency and revised funding allocation requirements. Affected special education local plan areas must now post submitted local plans on the department’s website, and for the 2023–24 fiscal year, they must allocate special education funds to member agencies using a new formula. This will require adjustments in district planning, compliance procedures, and budget methodologies.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       
                           This legislative change establishes a funding mechanism for special education programs whereby additional appropriations under the Budget Act of 2023 will be provided to local educational agencies if revenues received from successor agencies fall short of an estimated amount. The Director of Finance must make this determination on or before June 30, 2024, and adjust appropriations accordingly. As a result, local agencies involved in delivering special education services will need to monitor and report their funding levels, impacting budgeting and compliance processes.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts are directly impacted as their special education funding may be augmented if revenue from successor agencies is below the estimated level or reduced if revenues exceed that estimate. This change requires enhanced monitoring of revenue flows and accurate reporting for compliance with the new funding determination process. (Deadline: June 30, 2024)
Charter School: If Charter Schools are designated as local educational agencies receiving special education funding, they could experience similar funding adjustments. They should review their revenue reporting and funding status to ensure that any changes in augmentation are anticipated in their budgeting. (Deadline: June 30, 2024)
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, responsible for coordinating and distributing special education funds to school districts, will be indirectly affected. They must adjust oversight protocols to account for the new funding formulas and ensure that participating school districts comply with reporting requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2024)

                           The legislative change expands the Golden State Teacher Grant Program by including California preschool programs and altering key program parameters. The bill extends the repayment window from 3 to 6 years for incomplete teacher preparation, modifies service requirements by linking credit to the most recent priority school list, and adjusts funding criteria for qualifying online private institutions. These changes will indirectly impact local public agencies that host or administer priority schools and teacher preparation programs, requiring them to adjust placement practices, coordination efforts, and compliance protocols.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School Districts with schools designated as priority schools—including preschools—will need to adapt teacher placement and retention strategies. They must account for the new rule that teachers can satisfy service requirements at a school based on the most recently published priority list and remain bound to that school even if its designation changes.
Charter School: Charter Schools operating as priority schools or offering preschool programs may now host teachers under the expanded grant program. They will need to verify their eligibility on updated priority lists and adjust internal compliance measures to meet the revised service requirements.
County Office of Education: County Offices of Education, responsible for supporting and overseeing multiple local districts, will need to facilitate coordination regarding the new teacher placement and service guidelines, especially impacting preschool program operations within their counties.
Community College: Community Colleges that offer teacher preparation programs may be indirectly affected by the modifications in program eligibility criteria and the extended timeline for obtaining a preliminary credential. This may require updated advisement for students and adjustments in program administration practices.

                           The legislative change reiterates the constitutional requirement that the state must reimburse local agencies for costs mandated by state law. Specifically, if the Commission on State Mandates finds that this bill imposes such costs, then both school districts and other local agencies are entitled to reimbursement under statutory procedures. Affected agencies must document incurred expenses and follow the reimbursement process set out in Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
                       
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       School District: School districts are explicitly named; if state-mandated costs are determined by the Commission, they must follow statutory procedures to claim reimbursement.
County Office of Education: County offices supporting education may incur costs due to new state mandates and will be eligible for reimbursement under the established procedures.
City: Cities, as local governmental agencies subject to state mandates, can claim reimbursement for costs imposed by the state.
County: Counties affected by state mandates are required to follow the reimbursement procedures to recover costs incurred from such mandates.
Special District: Special districts that face expenses from state mandates will be eligible for reimbursement following the statutory process.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, operating across multiple jurisdictions and subject to state mandates, must adhere to the reimbursement procedures to recover associated costs.
Community College: Community colleges may also be indirectly impacted if state mandates impose costs on them, making them eligible for reimbursement under the constitutional provision.
