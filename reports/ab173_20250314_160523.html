                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill modifies the Ebony Alert system by expanding and revising the criteria law enforcement agencies must meet before requesting an Ebony Alert for missing Black youth. It affects city police departments and county sheriff&#39;s departments by establishing more specific requirements for determining when to request an Ebony Alert, including verifying that all local resources have been utilized and that public dissemination of information could aid in recovery. The bill also makes CHP&#39;s activation of an Ebony Alert mandatory rather than discretionary when they concur with the law enforcement agency&#39;s determination.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to identify alternative funding sources for grade separation projects that previously received funding from Cycle 6 of the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program and the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program, but had that funding reverted by the Budget Act of 2024. Cities, counties, special districts, and Joint Powers Authorities (JPAs) that sponsor transportation infrastructure projects are affected by this change. These local agencies may receive restored or alternative funding for their affected grade separation projects, particularly if their projects are at risk of losing federal/local funding commitments or facing schedule delays.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill expands the powers and responsibilities of the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General, enabling them to review/investigate adherence to contract provisions of any entity receiving high-speed rail project funds. Local public agencies (cities, counties, special districts) that contract with the High-Speed Rail Authority or receive high-speed rail project funds are affected. These agencies will now be subject to additional contractual requirements granting Inspector General access to records, extended whistleblower protections for their employees, and potentially increased scrutiny of their contract compliance.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation from a fixed 25% for planning and 75% for implementation to &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning with the remainder for implementation. This change affects cities, counties, special districts (particularly transportation-related), joint powers authorities (JPAs), and transit agencies that are eligible to apply for these competitive grants. These local public agencies now have more flexibility in how funds might be allocated between planning and implementation phases, potentially allowing more funding to flow to implementation projects if the full 25% isn&#39;t needed for planning.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       Cities and Counties: As eligible applicants for both planning and implementation grants, cities and counties will benefit from the increased flexibility in funding allocation between planning and implementation projects.
Transportation-related Special Districts: Special districts involved in transportation can apply for grants with the understanding that more implementation funding may be available than under the previous fixed allocation.
Joint Powers Authorities: JPAs are eligible for both planning and implementation grants and will operate under more flexible funding allocations when applying.
Transit Agencies: Transit agencies are specifically eligible for planning grants and will benefit from the potential for more implementation funding if planning needs are less than 25% of total program funds.

                       This bill creates a &#39;letter of no prejudice&#39; process for the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program, allowing lead applicant agencies to spend their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future state reimbursement if certain conditions are met. This impacts local public agencies that administer or operate port and freight infrastructure projects, including port authorities, cities, counties, special districts, and Joint Powers Authorities (JPAs). These agencies gain increased flexibility to advance approved port and transportation projects using local funds when state funding might be delayed, with a pathway to reimbursement once state funds become available.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill appropriates $100 million from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation&#39;s Active Transportation Program (ATP), which encourages increased use of active modes of transportation like biking and walking. Cities, counties, special districts, and JPAs involved in transportation planning are affected as they are eligible to apply for these ATP funds. These local agencies benefit from this appropriation as it provides additional funding opportunities for infrastructure projects that promote walking, biking, and other non-motorized transportation options through June 30, 2027.

                       This bill increases the maximum percentage of high-speed rail bond proceeds that can be used for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5%. This change does not directly impact local public agencies such as cities, counties, school districts, special districts, or JPAs.

                       This bill declares it will take immediate effect as it relates to appropriations for the Budget Bill, pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 12 of Article IV of the California Constitution. No local public agencies (cities, counties, school districts, special districts, JPAs) are directly affected by this legislative change. This is purely a procedural provision regarding the timing of when the state budget bill becomes effective, with no operational impacts, compliance requirements, or mandates for local agencies.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       This bill requires the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to submit annual reports to the Legislature on its zero-emission vehicles, including purchase information, performance analysis, and charging infrastructure details. No local public agencies (cities, counties, school districts, special districts, JPAs) are directly impacted by this legislation as it solely imposes reporting requirements on Caltrans, which is a state agency. The reports may indirectly benefit local agencies by providing data on zero-emission vehicle performance and infrastructure costs as they implement their own fleet transitions under the existing Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation.

                       This bill authorizes the Department of General Services, with DMV consent, to enter into a lease-purchase agreement for a new DMV field office in San Francisco as part of a potential mixed-use development that may include affordable housing. No local public agencies are directly impacted by this legislation, as it specifically authorizes actions by state agencies (DGS and DMV). The City and County of San Francisco may need to coordinate with state agencies regarding this development within its boundaries, but the bill imposes no direct requirements, deadlines, or compliance obligations on any local public agencies.
