                           This legislative change directs the Secretary of Transportation to work with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and reallocate available state funding for grade separation projects that are otherwise at risk of losing federal or local funding or facing schedule delays. Although the bill primarily changes state-level funding procedures, local agencies such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities could be indirectly affected by changes in funding commitments and budgeting needs for these transportation projects.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that have made local funding commitments for grade separation projects may need to re-examine their budgets, as state reallocation could modify the expected financial contributions. They may also be required to coordinate with state agencies to update project schedules and funding data.
County: Counties might face changes in their funding responsibilities for local transportation projects if state funds are redirected to cover grade separation projects. This may necessitate updating their budget plans and ensuring compliance with the new allocation procedures.
Special District: Special districts involved in local transportation or infrastructure projects could be indirectly impacted by the shift in state funding. They may need to reassess their financial contributions and adjust project financing strategies in line with new state guidelines.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, created through the collaboration of multiple local agencies, may need to enhance coordination to address potential changes in funding flows and project schedules due to the state’s direct allocation of funds.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       
                           The new legislative change adopts the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation, which mandates that government fleets—including those managed by local agencies—transition a portion of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles to zero-emission models. While the bill directly requires the Department of Transportation to report annually on its zero-emission vehicle acquisitions and performance, local agencies that manage fleets, such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities, are also impacted by the regulatory push. These agencies will likely need to revise procurement policies, invest in charging/refueling infrastructure, and coordinate with state benchmarks to ensure compliance.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities managing local government fleets must plan for the transition of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles to zero-emission models. This may involve updating procurement policies, investing in charging/refueling infrastructure, and aligning operational procedures with state guidelines as set out by the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
County: Counties with public service fleets will be indirectly impacted as the state’s mandates extend to local government fleets. They must review and update their fleet management practices to incorporate zero-emission vehicles, coordinate with state agencies, and adjust maintenance and procurement schedules accordingly. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Special District: Special Districts, particularly those that operate transportation or public works fleets, will need to adhere to the new mandates. This could involve revising their procurement standards and investing in supporting infrastructure to facilitate a shift to zero-emission vehicles. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities involved in regional transportation or other shared services must work collaboratively to comply with the advanced clean fleet requirements. This includes coordinating joint procurement, sharing infrastructure resources, and aligning regional fleet transition strategies. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)

                           The legislative change revises the oversight duties of the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General by expanding his/her review authority to include an examination of contract provisions for any public or private entity receiving high‐speed rail project funds. The bill mandates that all contracts or contract amendments executed on or after July 1, 2024 include provisions that allow the Inspector General access to records and property, and it extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees. While the primary focus is on the High-Speed Rail Authority, local public agencies that enter into contracts financed with high‐speed rail project funds—such as Cities, Counties, Special Districts, and Joint Powers Authorities—could be indirectly impacted by these new contract compliance and oversight requirements.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that contract for high‐speed rail-related construction, operations, or services using project funds must now include mandatory provisions granting the Inspector General access to records and property. They may also face IG audits and reviews if their contracts are not compliant. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
County: Counties entering into contracts related to high‐speed rail projects must amend their contracting practices to reflect the new statutory requirements. Extended whistleblower protections for contractor employees also mandate updates to employment policies. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
Special District: Special districts that become recipients of high‐speed rail project funds will need to review and possibly revise their contract language to ensure compliance with the new provision requiring IG access, as well as update policies related to whistleblower protections. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by multiple local entities that participate in high‐speed rail projects must ensure that joint contracts adhere to the updated statutory requirements. Coordination among member agencies is essential in implementing the mandatory IG access provisions. (Deadline: July 01, 2024)

                           The legislative change revises the funding allocation of the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the fixed split of 25% for planning and 75% for implementation to allow up to 25% for planning with the balance for implementation. Although this is a state-level change administered by the Department of Transportation, it indirectly impacts local agencies that are eligible to apply for competitive grants or partner on projects aimed at converting underutilized highways into multimodal corridors, especially in underserved communities. Local agencies must adjust budgetary processes, project planning, and collaborative strategies to comply with the new allocation flexibility.

                       City: Cities involved in local infrastructure and transportation projects may need to modify their project proposals and budget allocations to conform to the new funding criteria, allowing up to 25% for planning.
County: County governments, often responsible for major transportation projects, must reassess their planning and implementation budgets under the revised funding split, potentially impacting competitive grant applications.
Special District: Special Districts that may be eligible to secure funding under the pilot program need to adjust their financial and project planning frameworks in light of the new flexible allocation between planning and implementation.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, as collaborative entities formed between local agencies, must work together to determine optimal funding distribution for projects, taking into account the new possibility of allocating less than 25% for planning if appropriate.

                           The legislative change amends the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program by allowing local lead applicant agencies to apply for a &#39;letter of no prejudice&#39; from the Secretary of Transportation. This letter permits agencies to expend their own funds on approved port-related projects with the expectation of future reimbursement if specified conditions are met. The change introduces new compliance and financial tracking requirements for local agencies participating in these projects, with the provisions becoming inoperative on June 30, 2033 and fully repealed on January 1, 2034.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that administer or operate port-specific projects can now opt to self-fund projects by obtaining a letter of no prejudice, subject to future reimbursement and strict eligibility requirements, altering their budgeting and reporting practices. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
County: Counties involved in administering or operating eligible port projects must now comply with new procedures to secure early funding through self-expenditure, with subsequent reimbursement conditions that require meticulous record keeping. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Special District: Special districts managing port or freight infrastructure projects may use their own funds by applying for a letter of no prejudice, which introduces new compliance obligations and necessitates adjustments to their financial management procedures. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed by collaborating local agencies can collectively apply for the letter of no prejudice to facilitate early funding for collaborative port projects, requiring coordinated compliance, documentation, and expense tracking. (Deadline: June 30, 2033)

                           This legislative change appropriates $100,000,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation for the Active Transportation Program. Although the funds are administered and allocated by the California Transportation Commission, the opportunity for funding and compliance with new state guidelines will indirectly affect local agencies. Local entities that participate in metropolitan planning or that implement infrastructure projects involving active transportation improvements may need to adjust their planning, proposal submissions, and compliance measures to align with state timelines and program requirements.

                       City: Cities may benefit by having their infrastructure projects—such as improved bike lanes or pedestrian walkways—funded through the state’s active transportation initiative as metropolitan planning agencies allocate funds. They should prepare proposals and ensure compliance with state design and application guidelines. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
County: Counties overseeing regional transportation projects may indirectly receive benefits as state funds filter down to local projects. County agencies should review infrastructure needs and align project planning with the active transportation program requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Special District: Special Districts that manage local transit or related services may be impacted through indirect funding opportunities. They will need to ensure their project proposals and operations meet the new state funding guidelines and deadlines. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, formed by multiple local entities, may need to jointly develop proposals for projects eligible under the active transportation funding program. They must ensure their collaborative projects meet state deadlines and regulatory requirements. (Deadline: June 30, 2027)

                           The bill expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program to cover funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the formula-based component of the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. As a result, regional transportation planning agencies—commonly structured as Joint Powers Authorities, and in some cases operating as or in collaboration with Cities, Counties, or Special Districts—must now submit updated regional short‐term financial plans and transit operator data over additional fiscal years. This change imposes new compliance, reporting, and coordination requirements that will affect the internal processes of these agencies as well as their funding eligibility.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       Joint Powers Authority: Regional transportation planning agencies, which are often structured as Joint Powers Authorities, are now required to submit an updated regional short-term financial plan and updated transit operator data for FY2025–26, and updated transit operator data for FY2026–27 and FY2027–28. This change increases their reporting burden and requires adjustments to existing internal compliance processes.
Special District: Local transit agencies operating as Special Districts that participate in the regional planning process may face indirect impacts as changes in accountability guidelines could affect funding formulas and compliance standards.
County: County-level agencies involved with regional transportation planning may be indirectly affected if their transit or planning departments are responsible for assembling or verifying the data required under the revised accountability program.
City: Cities that contribute to or benefit from regional transportation planning efforts may experience indirect impacts due to modified funding guidelines and compliance requirements, which can ultimately affect local transit project funding.

                           The bill increases the maximum percentage of high‐speed rail bond proceeds that may be used for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5%. Although the change is made at the state level to better support planning and management of high‐speed rail projects, it can indirectly affect local agencies that interface with state transportation planning, permitting, and infrastructure integration. Local entities may need to adjust coordination efforts and review their internal processes as state funding formulas and administrative oversight evolve.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities may face new coordination demands with state agencies due to additional administrative funds being available. This could lead to revised processes for permitting and aligning local infrastructure projects with the state’s high‐speed rail development plans.
County: Counties might experience changes in regional planning practices and permitting requirements as the state reallocates more funds for administrative purposes. This shift may alter local oversight and the coordination needed for integrating high‐speed rail projects with county infrastructure.
Special District: Special districts involved in transportation or infrastructure services could need to revise their internal administrative practices to align with a state process that now allows a higher allocation for administrative functions, potentially affecting local project priorities and compliance.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that bring together multiple local agencies for regional transportation projects may need to revisit or update their agreements to handle new administrative processes dictated by the increased state allocation, potentially complicating collaboration.

                           The legislative change authorizes the Department of General Services, with DMV consent, to enter into a lease‐purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility to replace the DMV field office in San Francisco. The project, which may incorporate mixed-use elements including affordable housing, is subject to legislative notice requirements, Department of Finance approval, and compliance with the Property Acquisition Law. As a result, local agencies in the City and County of San Francisco may be required to coordinate on planning, zoning, and regulatory compliance with potential indirect impacts on service delivery and infrastructure.

County: The County of San Francisco could experience indirect impacts through the need to monitor land use changes and local service adjustments resulting from the new facility, including considerations for infrastructure and community resource allocation.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       
                           <em class="digest-only">(Legislative Counsel&#39;s Digest) Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to request the Department of the California Highway Patrol to activate an Ebony Alert, with respect to Black youth who are reported missing, as specified. Existing law requires, as a condition for requesting an Ebony Alert, that the agency determine that the alert would be an effective tool in the investigation of missing Black youth, and lists factors that the agency may consider in making that determination. If the department concurs with the agency’s determination, existing law authorizes the department to activate an Ebony Alert within the appropriate geographical area requested by the investigating law enforcement agency and to assist the agency by disseminating specified alert messages and signs.
This bill would expand and revise the determinations a law enforcement agency must make to request an Ebony Alert. In this regard, the bill would require determinations that, among other things, the investigating law enforcement agency has used all available local resources and there is information available that, if disseminated to the public, could assist in the safe recovery of the missing person. If the department concurs with the agency’s determination, the bill would make the department’s activation of an Ebony Alert and assistance to the agency, as described above, required. The bill would require, on or before July 1, 2027, the department to create and submit a report to the Governor’s office and the Legislature, as specified.</em>
