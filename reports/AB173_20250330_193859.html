                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change directs the Secretary of Transportation to work with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and reallocate available state funds for grade separation projects that risk losing federal and local funding. Although the bill primarily targets state-level transportation agencies, its provisions will indirectly affect local public agencies that participate in funding and executing these projects. Local agencies involved in infrastructure projects—such as cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities—may need to review their funding commitments, adjust project plans, and coordinate more closely with state agencies to offset potential shortfalls.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities with grade separation projects that rely partly on local funding commitments may see state reallocation of funds affect their financial planning and project timelines. They should review ongoing projects to ensure that local funding gaps are addressed.
County: Counties involved in transportation infrastructure projects may be impacted if state funds are directed to cover local funding shortfalls in grade separation projects. They need to verify that their matching funds and project schedules align with new state procedures.
Special District: Special districts that manage specific transportation or infrastructure projects may face operational changes if state funds are reallocated to support projects at risk. They should prepare for compliance with revised funding allocation measures.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed to manage multi-agency transportation projects might be affected by state prioritization and direct allocation of funds. Coordinated efforts will be necessary to ensure that local funding commitments are met and projects remain on schedule.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change expands the Transportation Agency’s accountability program to include funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund for the formula-based component of the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. In practical terms, regional transportation planning agencies – which are often structured as cities, counties, special districts, or joint powers authorities – must now update and submit their regional short‐term financial plans and transit operator data on an annual basis (starting with the 2025–26 fiscal year and continuing in the following fiscal years) to qualify for funding. The shift in funding source and reporting requirements imposes new compliance and administrative tasks, indirectly affecting local public agencies involved in transit planning and operations.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities involved in regional transit planning may need to provide updated transit operator data to ensure compliance with the expanded accountability program. This change could require adjustments to internal reporting processes and coordination with state authorities to secure fund allocations.
County: Counties serving as regional transportation planning agencies must update their regional short‐term financial plans for the 2025–26 fiscal year and provide updated transit operator data in subsequent years. This will likely demand enhancements in financial monitoring and reporting systems to meet new state-imposed standards.
Special District: Transit-oriented special districts acting as regional transportation planning agencies are subject to additional reporting requirements to access new funding sources. They must adjust financial data submissions and monitor state-mandated guideline modifications.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that help coordinate regional transit initiatives are required to update and submit the relevant financial plans and transit operator data. This necessitates enhanced coordination among participating entities to comply with the new submission timelines.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change mandates a transition toward zero‐emission vehicles for government fleets, including local, state, and federal agencies. While state agencies face explicit quotas and reporting deadlines, local agencies operating medium‐ and heavy‐duty vehicles (such as those managed by Cities, Counties, Special Districts, and Joint Powers Authorities) are indirectly impacted. They will need to assess their current fleet, update procurement policies, allocate budgets, and plan for charging/refueling infrastructure to achieve compliance with the Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that operate fleets including medium- and heavy-duty trucks must evaluate their current vehicle inventory, update procurement policies, and develop plans to transition to zero-emission vehicles. This impact is indirect, arising from state-level mandates, and may require investment in new infrastructure and revised maintenance protocols. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
County: Counties managing local government fleets will need to align their vehicle acquisition and maintenance practices with the new state mandates. This requires a re-evaluation of current fleets and preparation for the gradual integration of zero-emission vehicles to meet compliance standards. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Special District: Special Districts that operate functional fleets, such as for public works or transportation services, must adapt to changed operational requirements. They will face indirect pressure to transition their fleets to zero-emission vehicles while managing potential impacts on service delivery and maintenance protocols. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities that oversee fleets across multiple local agencies must coordinate to harmonize policies and transition strategies. This collective approach is needed to address shared vehicle acquisition standards and infrastructure requirements imposed indirectly by state mandates. (Deadline: December 31, 2025)

                       This legislative change amends state law governing the High-Speed Rail Authority by expanding the Inspector General&#39;s powers. The amendments require that all contracts and contract amendments using high-speed rail project funds executed on or after July 1, 2024, include specific provisions granting the Inspector General access to records and property. In addition, whistleblower protections are extended to employees of contractors receiving such project funds. While the change directly targets the High-Speed Rail Authority and its Inspector General, it indirectly affects local public agencies—especially those acting as contracting entities—by imposing new compliance, contractual, and oversight requirements.

                       The bill amends the funding structure of the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by replacing a fixed 25% planning allocation with a flexible provision of &#39;up to&#39; 25% for planning, with the remainder for implementation. This change, although minor, may require local agencies to adjust their budgeting, planning, and compliance practices when participating in projects that transform underutilized state highways into multimodal corridors serving underserved communities.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities involved in projects under this pilot program may see a variable amount of funding available for the planning phase. This change could require them to reexamine their project budgeting and seek supplemental resources or adjust project scopes to meet planning needs.
County: Counties participating in infrastructure projects funded through this program may need to realign their allocation of funds between planning and implementation in accordance with the new flexible funding structure. This may involve revising project proposals and financial planning.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities, often formed by partnerships of multiple local agencies, must review and potentially modify inter-agency agreements to reflect the flexible planning funds. This could affect how partner agencies coordinate and fund the planning phase of multimodal corridor projects.
Special District: Special Districts engaged in relevant infrastructure projects might face changes in the available planning funds, necessitating updates to their internal budgeting and project planning methods to ensure compliance with the new funding split.

                       The legislative change amends the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to allow a lead applicant agency to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This letter permits the agency to expend its own funds on eligible port and freight projects with the expectation of future reimbursement if specific conditions are met. The change introduces new funding flexibility as well as compliance and reporting obligations. Its impact is indirect on local agencies that administer or operate these projects, affecting budgeting, financial planning, and oversight. The provisions are temporary, becoming inoperative on 2033-06-30 and repealed on 2034-01-01.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The legislative change increases the portion of high-speed rail bond proceeds that can be allocated to administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5%. While the primary objective is to support state-level planning, engineering, and management of the high-speed rail system, local agencies may be indirectly impacted when state and local efforts intersect in project oversight, local permitting, and intergovernmental coordination.

                    <!-- Impact Description -->
                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that host high-speed rail stations or are affected by adjacent infrastructure improvements may need to align their local permitting processes and inter-agency coordination with state administrative practices. The increase in administrative funding could mean new reporting and compliance requirements if local governments are part of regional transit planning entities.
County: Counties involved in regional transportation planning or hosting parts of the high-speed rail corridor may face adaptations in budgeting and oversight requirements. They might need to modify local processes to ensure proper coordination with state agencies in light of increased administrative expenses allocated from bond proceeds.
Special District: Special districts that provide local transportation or infrastructure services could experience changes in the funding landscape. With a higher administrative allocation, there may be implications for how much funding is available for capital improvements, requiring a review of local contracts and project plans.
Joint Powers Authority: Joint Powers Authorities formed to manage regional transit initiatives might need to update their governance and compliance protocols. The reallocation of bond proceeds could necessitate revised oversight and reporting standards for multi-agency projects involving high-speed rail.

                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
                       The bill appropriates $100 million from the General Fund to the Department of Transportation to support the Active Transportation Program. Although the funding is managed at the state level via the California Transportation Commission and metropolitan planning agencies, local public agencies may be indirectly impacted. Cities, counties, special districts, and joint powers authorities could be involved in submitting project proposals, coordinating with regional planning bodies, and ensuring compliance with state guidelines. The appropriation comes with set deadlines for fund allocation (by 2027-06-30) and for encumbrance and liquidation (by 2030-06-30), which local agencies must account for if they seek to benefit from these funds.

                       The bill authorizes the Department of General Services, with consent from the Department of Motor Vehicles, to enter into a lease‐purchase or lease with an option to purchase agreement for a build-to-suit office facility to replace the DMV field office in San Francisco. The project, which may be developed as a mixed-use facility incorporating affordable housing, triggers state-level requirements—including adherence to legislative notice protocols, the Property Acquisition Law, and approval by the Department of Finance—that can indirectly affect local governmental processes such as zoning, permitting, and local fiscal oversight in San Francisco.

County: The County of San Francisco may be indirectly affected through changes in property acquisition processes and lease-purchase agreements, impacting local fiscal planning and necessitating oversight of compliance with state-mandated development requirements.
