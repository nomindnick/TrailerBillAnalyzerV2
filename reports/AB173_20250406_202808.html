                           This legislative change amends Government Code Section 8594.14 regarding the Ebony Alert system for missing Black youth. It expands and revises the determinations law enforcement agencies must make before requesting an Ebony Alert from the California Highway Patrol (CHP), changes the CHP&#39;s activation from discretionary to mandatory when they concur with the agency&#39;s determination, and requires the CHP to submit a report by July 1, 2027. This primarily impacts local law enforcement agencies operated by cities and counties.

                           This bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to identify alternative funding for grade separation projects that had previously received state funding that was reverted in the Budget Act of 2024. The Transportation Agency must prioritize projects at risk of losing federal/local funding commitments or facing schedule delays. This change impacts local agencies that sponsor or participate in grade separation projects (road/rail crossing infrastructure).

                           This legislation expands the Transportation Agency&#39;s accountability program to include Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund distributions for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. It requires regional transportation planning agencies (RTPAs) to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data for fiscal years 2025-26 through 2027-28 to receive funding, and authorizes the Transportation Agency to modify distribution guidelines.

                           This bill authorizes the Department of General Services to enter into a lease-purchase agreement for a new DMV facility in San Francisco, potentially as a mixed-use development that may include affordable housing. While primarily a state-level action, it has implications for local agencies in San Francisco.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: The City of San Francisco may be impacted through land use planning, permitting processes, and coordination requirements for the new DMV facility, particularly if it includes affordable housing as part of a mixed-use development. The city may need to coordinate on infrastructure, services, and potentially participate in affordable housing components.
County: As San Francisco is both a city and county, the County will need to coordinate on aspects of the development related to county functions, including property records and assessments.
Special District: Special districts in the area of the new facility (such as transit or utility districts) may need to plan for service adjustments or infrastructure modifications to accommodate the new development.

                           This legislation expands the duties and authority of the High-Speed Rail Authority Inspector General to review or investigate adherence to contract provisions of any public or private entity that receives high-speed rail project funds. It defines &#39;personnel issues,&#39; extends whistleblower protections to contractor employees, and requires contracts executed after July 1, 2024, to include provisions granting the inspector general access to records and property.

                           This bill modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation structure. Previously, the program mandated a fixed 25% for planning and 75% for implementation. The amendment changes this to &#39;up to 25%&#39; for planning and the remainder for implementation, giving Caltrans more flexibility in fund allocation. This impacts local agencies that may apply for grants to convert underutilized state highways into multimodal corridors serving underserved communities.

                    <p><strong>Impact Description:</strong><br>
                       City: Cities that apply for grants under this program will be affected by the revised funding allocation. The change from a fixed 25% for planning to &#39;up to 25%&#39; means potentially more funding could be directed toward implementation projects. Cities may need to adjust their grant application strategies and project timelines accordingly.
County: Counties involved in highway conversion projects may see shifts in available planning vs. implementation funding. This could affect county transportation planning and project execution strategies for converting state highways within county jurisdiction.
Special District: Transportation-related special districts eligible for this program may experience changes in how they can access funding between planning and implementation phases, potentially favoring districts ready for implementation over those in planning stages.
Joint Powers Authority: JPAs formed for regional transportation initiatives will be affected by the modified funding allocation, particularly those focused on highway conversions in underserved communities.

                           This bill amends the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to allow lead applicant agencies to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This mechanism permits agencies to use their own funds for approved port infrastructure projects with the ability to receive future reimbursement from program funds, subject to certain conditions. The provision expires on June 30, 2033.

                       City: Cities that operate ports or manage port-adjacent infrastructure (such as Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco, San Diego) can now initiate approved port and freight infrastructure projects using local funds and seek reimbursement later through the program. This provides timing flexibility for priority projects.
County: Counties involved in regional transportation planning that includes port and freight infrastructure can now use local funds for approved projects with potential for later reimbursement.
Special District: Port authorities and transportation special districts can advance approved projects using their own funds with the ability to receive reimbursement later through the program.
Joint Powers Authority: Regional transportation JPAs involved in port and freight infrastructure projects can utilize this mechanism to advance approved projects before state funding is available.

The California Transportation Commission will allocate these funds, with an allocation deadline of June 30, 2027, and an encumbrance/liquidation deadline of June 30, 2030. This creates significant funding opportunities for local agencies to implement active transportation infrastructure projects.

                           This legislative change increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% for the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century. This adjustment could potentially reduce funds available for actual project implementation by up to 2.5% of the $9 billion in bond proceeds (approximately $225 million), which might indirectly affect local agencies that coordinate with the high-speed rail project.

                       City: Cities along the high-speed rail route that coordinate with the project for right-of-way, permits, and infrastructure integration may experience changes in project timelines or implementation due to the reallocation of funds from project implementation to administration.
County: Counties along the high-speed rail route that coordinate with the project may experience changes in project timelines or implementation due to the reallocation of funds from project implementation to administration.
Special District: Transit-related special districts with connectivity planning related to the high-speed rail system may experience changes in project coordination due to the reallocation of funds from project implementation to administration.
Joint Powers Authority: Regional transportation JPAs that coordinate planning with the high-speed rail project may need to adjust their plans due to potential changes in project implementation resulting from the reallocation of funds.

                           This legislation is a Budget Bill trailer bill that takes effect immediately upon enactment as allowed under Article IV, Section 12(e) of the California Constitution. The bill contains appropriations related to the state Budget Bill, but the specific appropriations and policy details are not provided in the text. While marked as having &#39;NO Local Program&#39; impact, budget appropriation bills may still indirectly affect local agencies through funding allocations or program changes.
