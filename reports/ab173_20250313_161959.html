                       This bill mandates the Secretary of Transportation to collaborate with the Department of Transportation and the California Transportation Commission to identify and allocate available state transportation funds for grade separation projects that lost funding due to the Budget Act of 2024. It affects local public agencies involved in transportation projects, such as cities and counties, by providing a mechanism to secure funding for projects at risk of losing federal and local commitments or facing delays. These agencies are impacted as they may receive prioritized funding to continue or complete their projects.

                       This bill authorizes the Department of General Services, with the consent of the Department of Motor Vehicles, to enter into a lease-purchase agreement or lease with an option to purchase for a new build-to-suit office facility to replace the DMV field office in San Francisco. The project may include mixed-use development with affordable housing. The lease is subject to approval by the Department of Finance and legislative notice requirements. This change primarily affects state agencies, specifically the Department of General Services and the Department of Motor Vehicles, as it allows them to engage in specific real estate transactions previously restricted without legislative authorization.

                       This bill modifies the Reconnecting Communities: Highways to Boulevards Pilot Program by changing the funding allocation from a fixed 25% for planning and 75% for implementation to a flexible allocation of up to 25% for planning and the remainder for implementation. This change affects local public agencies such as cities, counties, and joint powers authorities (JPAs) that are eligible to apply for these grants. These agencies are impacted as they may need to adjust their project proposals and funding strategies to align with the new funding allocation rules.

                       This bill introduces a provision allowing lead applicant agencies under the Port and Freight Infrastructure Program to apply for a letter of no prejudice from the Secretary of Transportation. This letter permits agencies to use their own funds on approved projects with the possibility of future reimbursement, provided certain conditions are met. The affected local public agencies include those administering or operating eligible port-related projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts. These agencies are impacted by gaining the flexibility to advance project timelines using their own funds while awaiting state reimbursement, which could expedite project completion and improve goods movement capacity.

                       This bill expands the accountability program requirements for the distribution of funds from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to regional transportation planning agencies under the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. It affects regional transportation planning agencies by requiring them to submit updated financial plans and transit operator data to receive funds for the 2025–26 fiscal year and updated transit operator data for the 2026–27 and 2027–28 fiscal years. This impacts these agencies by imposing additional compliance requirements to access funding.

                       This bill increases the percentage of bond proceeds available for administrative purposes from 2.5% to 5% under the Safe, Reliable, High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act for the 21st Century. This change affects local public agencies involved in the planning and implementation of high-speed rail projects, such as cities, counties, and special districts, by allowing more funds to be allocated for administrative costs. These agencies are impacted as they may need to adjust their budgeting and financial planning to accommodate the increased administrative funding cap.
