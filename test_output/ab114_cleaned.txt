Education finance: education omnibus budget trailer bill.(1) Existing law establishes a public school financing system that requires state funding for school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to be calculated pursuant to a local control funding formula, as specified. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to annually calculate a county local control funding formula for each county superintendent of schools that includes, among other things, an alternative education grant, as specified. Existing law includes, among other things, a base grant based upon average daily attendance as a component of that alternative education grant.This bill would revise the alternative education grant by, among other things, increasing the base grant component of the alternative education grant, revising the calculation of average daily attendance for purposes of the alternative education grant, as specified, and establishing add-ons of $200,000 for each county office of education that operates a juvenile court school and $200,000 for each county office of education that operates a county community school. The bill would require the Superintendent to allocate $3,000 per unit of average daily attendance for a Student Support and Enrichment Block Grant, as provided. The bill would make these provisions applicable commencing with the 2023–24 fiscal year.(2) Existing law, commencing with the 2018–19 fiscal year, requires the Superintendent to add $200,000 and other specified amounts, that are dependent upon the number and size of school districts under its jurisdiction and that are determined to be in need of differentiated assistance, to a county superintendent of school’s local control funding formula allocation, as specified.This bill, commencing with the 2023–24 fiscal year, would increase the above-described add-on by $100,000.(3) Existing law, commencing with the 2015–16 fiscal year, requires the Superintendent to add $2,000,000 to the Los Angeles County Office of Education’s local control funding formula allocation for the purpose of supporting statewide professional development and leadership training for education professionals related to antibias education and the creation of inclusive and equitable schools.This bill would, commencing with the 2023–24 fiscal year, increase that add-on for the Los Angeles County Office of Education by $1,000,000 to instead be $3,000,000.(4) The Early Education Act requires the Superintendent to administer the California state preschool program. The act also requires the Superintendent, in consultation with the Director of Social Services and the executive director of the State Board of Education, to convene a statewide interest holder workgroup to provide recommendations on best practices for increasing access to high-quality universal preschool programs for 3- and 4-year-old children offered through a mixed-delivery model that provides equitable learning experiences across a variety of settings. The act requires the Superintendent, in consultation with the director, to provide a report to the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature and the Department of Finance with the recommendations of the workgroup no later than January 15, 2023.This bill would delay the reporting of those recommendations described above to instead be no later than March 31, 2024.(5) Existing law establishes the California Prekindergarten Planning and Implementation Grant Program as a state early learning initiative with the goal of expanding access to classroom-based prekindergarten programs. Existing law appropriates $300,000,000 from the General Fund to the State Department of Education in both the 2021–22 fiscal year and the 2022–23 fiscal year for allocation to local educational agencies as base grants, enrollment grants, and supplemental grants, as specified.The bill would authorize the department to allocate or prorate unexpended funds returned by or collected from a grant recipient for grants to local educational agencies for costs associated with the educational expenses of current and future California state preschool program, transitional kindergarten, and kindergarten professionals that support their attainment of required credentials, permits, or professional development in early childhood instruction or child development, including developing competencies in serving inclusive classrooms and dual language learners, as provided. By authorizing the use of appropriated funds for new purposes, the bill would make an appropriation.(6) Existing law establishes the After School Education and Safety Program under which participating public schools receive grants to operate before and after school programs serving pupils in kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 9, inclusive. Existing law authorizes specified entities to apply for grants under the After School Education and Safety Program, including local educational agencies and cities, counties, and nonprofit organizations in partnership with, and with the approval of, a local educational agency.This bill would require a local educational agency that contracts with a third party to operate before and after school programs to require the third party to (A) notify the local educational agency of any health- or safety-related issues, as specified, and (B) to request from parents or guardians pupil health information, as provided.(7) Existing law, the California School Finance Authority Act, authorizes a participating party, as defined, in connection with securing financing or refinancing of projects, or working capital, as defined, to elect to guarantee or provide for payment of the bonds and related obligations in accordance with specified conditions. Existing law requires participating parties to, among other things, elect to participate by an action of its governing board and provide written notice to the Controller. Existing law authorizes school districts and county offices of education with qualified or negative financial certifications, as provided, to intercept payments only for short-term financings, as provided.This bill would revise and recast those provisions by, among other things, authorizing participating parties to elect to participate in a local intercept by sending to the county treasurer, or other appropriate county fiscal officer, a request for the county to participate. If the county agrees to participate, the bill would require the county treasurer or other county fiscal officer to make an apportionment or revenue transfer, as provided. This bill would limit the authorization of school districts and county offices of education with qualified or negative financial certifications to intercept payments for indebtedness for which the repayment is determined to be probable, as provided.(8) Existing law establishes the California Preschool, Transitional Kindergarten, and Full-Day Kindergarten Facilities Grant Program under the administration of the State Allocation Board, to provide one-time grants to school districts to, among other things, construct new school facilities or retrofit existing school facilities for the purpose of providing transitional kindergarten classrooms and full-day kindergarten classrooms, as provided. Existing law appropriates, during specific fiscal years, specified sums of money to the board to provide the grants.This bill would extend the time that the above described appropriated funds are available for encumbrance or expenditure by the board until specified dates during specified fiscal years, thereby making an appropriation.(9) Existing law creates the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund in the State Treasury for the purpose of receiving appropriations for school districts, county offices of education, charter schools, and community college districts related to the state of emergency declared by the Governor on March 4, 2020, relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing law appropriates $7,936,000,000 from the General Fund to the State Department of Education for transfer to the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to allocate these appropriated funds to school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools, as provided. Existing law authorizes allocated funds to be used for learning recovery initiatives through the 2027–28 school year that, at a minimum, support academic learning recovery, and staff and pupil social and emotional well-being. Existing law requires local educational agencies receiving these allocations to report interim expenditures to the department by December 1, 2024, and December 1, 2027, and to submit a final report no later than December 1, 2029.This bill would reduce the above-described appropriation from the General Fund to the State Department of Education for transfer to the Learning Recovery Emergency Fund by $1,590,595,000 to instead be $6,345,405,000, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would require local educational agencies receiving these allocations to instead report interim expenditures to the department by December 15, 2024, and annually thereafter, and to submit a final report on expenditures by December 15, 2029.(10) Existing law requires a school district to use its uniform complaint process to help identify and resolve any deficiencies related to instructional materials, emergency or urgent facilities conditions that pose a threat to the health and safety of pupils or staff, and teacher vacancy or misassignment, as provided. Under existing law, the procedure required under the uniform complaint process is intended to address, among other things, a complaint related to teacher misassignment that claims that a teacher who lacks credentials or training to teach English learners is assigned to teach a class with more than 20% of English learner pupils in the class.This bill would establish that the procedure required under the uniform complaint process is instead intended to address a complaint related to teacher misassignment that claims that a teacher who lacks credentials or training to teach English learners is assigned to teach a class with one or more English learner pupils in the class. To the extent this imposes new obligations on school districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.(11) Existing law requires the Controller to create an audit guide that includes, among other things, instructions for procedures for determining, among other things, if there any unspent funds associated with the completion of a Charter School Facilities Program project, a Career Technical Education Facilities Program project, or a project where the local educational agency received hardship funding, as provided.This bill would delete the requirements that the Controller’s audit guide include instructions for procedures for determining if there are any unspent funds associated with the completion of a Charter School Facilities Program project, a Career Technical Education Facilities Program project, and a project where the local educational agency received hardship funding, as provided.(12) For the 1990–91 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, existing law requires that moneys to be applied by the state for the support of school districts, community college districts, and direct elementary and secondary level instructional services provided by the state be distributed in accordance with certain calculations governing the proration of those moneys among the 3 segments of public education. Existing law makes that provision inapplicable to the 1992–93 to 2022–23 fiscal years, inclusive.This bill would also make that provision inapplicable to the 2023–24 fiscal year.(13) Existing law, commencing with the 2022–23 fiscal year, requires a transportation allowance equal to 60% of the home-to-school transportation expenditures reported by the school district or county superintendent of schools as determined by its Function 3600 entry in the Standardized Account Code Structure report for the prior year, excluding capital outlay and nonagency expenditures, and reduced by the amount of a school district’s or county superintendent of schools’ transportation add-on under the local control funding formula, as adjusted. As a condition of receiving those apportionments, existing law requires a local educational agency to develop a plan describing the transportation services it will offer to its pupils, and how it will prioritize planned transportation services for pupils in transitional kindergarten, kindergarten, and any of grades 1 to 6, inclusive, and pupils who are low income, among other requirements related to this plan.Existing law authorizes a school district to convert all of its schools to charter schools if it meets certain specified requirements and its petition is approved by both the Superintendent and the State Board of Education.This bill would make the above-described transportation funding provisions inapplicable to a school district with an approved districtwide charter petition.(14) Existing law requires funding pursuant to the local control funding formula to include, in addition to a base grant, supplemental and concentration grant add-ons that are based on the percentage of unduplicated pupils, as specified, served by the county superintendent of schools, school district, or charter school. For purposes of the local control funding formula, existing law defines unduplicated pupil to mean a pupil who is classified as an English learner, eligible for a free or reduced-price meal, or a foster youth, as specified.This bill would, commencing with the 2023–24 fiscal year, annually appropriate $300,000,000 from the General Fund to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for allocation for the Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier apportionment, which the bill would establish, as provided. The bill would require the funding to be allocated to eligible local educational agencies, as defined, on a per-unit basis of a schoolsite’s total prior year adjusted cumulative enrollment, as specified, and would require an eligible schoolsite to receive not less than $50,000 annually for purposes of this apportionment. The bill would require the State Department of Education to submit an annual report to the relevant policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, the State Board of Education, and the Department of Finance that includes specified information on pupil outcomes from the apportionment, as provided.(15) Existing law requires a school employer, as defined, to notify an employee when a wage overpayment has been made to the employee and afford the employee an opportunity to respond before commencing recoupment actions, and requires reimbursement to be made through one of 3 specified methods mutually agreed to by the employee and the employer. Existing law requires installment amounts deducted from payment of salary or wages pursuant to these provisions to not exceed 25% of the employee’s net disposable earnings, except as specified. Existing law prohibits an administrative action taken by the employer to recover an overpayment unless the action is initiated within 3 years from the date of overpayment. The bill would provide that if these provisions conflict with a memorandum of understanding, the memorandum of understanding controls without further legislative action, except as provided.This bill would revise and recast those provisions by, among other things, requiring the school employer to notify the school employee in writing of an overpayment and specified rights, deleting the authorization for a school employer to require full repayment through payroll deductions for overpayments that have occurred for more than one year, revising the limits for installment payments, as specified, and, if a school employee disputes the existence or amount of a school employer’s claimed overpayment, requiring the school employer to first initiate a legal action and obtain a court order or a binding arbitration decision validating the claimed overpayment amount, as specified. The bill would instead provide that if these provisions conflict with a memorandum of understanding, and it was in effect on July 31, 2022, the memorandum of understanding controls until its expiration or renewal.(16) Existing law requires the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, among other duties, to establish standards for the issuance and renewal of credentials, certificates, and permits. Existing law requires the commission to administer the State Assignment Accountability System to provide local educational agencies with a data system for assignment monitoring. Existing law requires the commission and the State Department of Education to enter into a data sharing agreement to provide the commission with employee assignment data necessary to annually identify misassignments and vacant positions at local educational agencies. Existing law authorizes the commission to promulgate regulations that define standards for a local educational agency, including a charter school, that consistently misassigns employees and what sanctions, if any, to impose on that local educational agency. Existing law requires the Superintendent to identify a list of schools for which the county superintendent, or a designee, shall inspect annually and submit an annual report that describes the state of schools in the county, as provided. As part of the development of that list, existing law requires the Superintendent to identify a list of schools where 15% or more of the teachers are holders of a permit, certificate, or any other authorization that is a lesser certification than a preliminary or clear California teaching credential.This bill would revise and recast those provisions by, among other things, requiring the department to provide the commission with educator assignment data necessary to annually identify educator assignments, including assignments filled by individuals on preliminary or clear credentials, intern credentials, permits or waivers, misassignments, and vacant positions at local educational agencies. The bill would also require the commission to ensure local educational agencies have access to the results of the accountability system’s process of assignment monitoring, publish annual certificated educator assignment data that reflects the level of preparation and licensure of educators serving California pupils, and support the department in providing annual updates that provide comprehensive information on teaching assignment outcomes inclusive of all educator classifications at the schoolsite, school district, and county level. The bill would expand the commission’s above-described authority to promulgate regulations to apply to local educational agencies that consistently misassign educators, instead of employees, as provided. The bill would require the Superintendent to include on the list of schools where 15% or more of the teachers are holders of a permit, certificate, or any other authorization that is a lesser certification than a preliminary or clear California teaching credential all schools, except for alternative schools, within a local educational agency that fail to meet certain requirements. To the extent that this bill would create new duties for county superintendents of schools and local educational agencies, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.This bill would require the commission, on or before September 30, 2023, to examine and determine how it can ensure that transcripts will be reviewed for all candidates requiring determinations of basic skills or subject matter competence in order to complete their credentialing requirements, and, by November 15, 2023, provide recommendations on ways in which efficient transcript review can be provided to all candidates who require determinations to the relevant policy committees and budget subcommittees of the Legislature, the executive director of the State Board of Education or the director’s designee, and the Director of Finance.(17) Existing law establishes the Teacher Credentials Fund, requires all fees levied and collected by the commission to be deposited in the fund, and prohibits those fees from being transferred to any other fund. Existing law also establishes the Test Development and Administration Account in the Teacher Credentials Fund, and requires all fees collected by the commission for tests, examinations, or assessments to be deposited in the account. Existing law requires the Department of Finance to recommend a reduction in credential or other fees if, at the beginning of any fiscal year, the commission has surplus funds, as provided.This bill would, commencing July 1, 2023, require all fees collected by the commission for tests, examinations, or assessments to instead be deposited in the Teacher Credentials Fund and would exempt these fees from the above-described requirements related to fee reductions when the commission has surplus funds, as provided. The bill would require these funds to be expended for the development, agency support, maintenance, or administration of tests or other assessments established, required, or administered by the commission, unless otherwise authorized by the Legislature. The bill would require the Department of Finance to annually recommend to the Legislature, as part of the budget review process, an appropriate credential fee sufficient to generate revenues necessary to support the operating budget of the commission plus a prudent reserve, as provided.(18) Existing law establishes that a preliminary teaching credential shall be valid for 5 years, pending completion of the clear credential program. Existing law requires the commission to grant or deny a completed application for a credential within 7 days of the date that the commission received the application if the applicant supplies the commission with evidence that the applicant is married to, or in a domestic partnership or other legal union with, an active duty member of the Armed Forces of the United States who is assigned to a duty station in this state under official active duty military orders and holds a valid teaching credential in another state, district, or territory of the United States.This bill would require the commission to issue a comparable credential to any United States military service member or their spouse or domestic partner, or a surviving spouse or domestic partner of a service member who died while serving as an active duty member of the Armed Forces of the United States in the previous 12 months, who, among other things, possesses and provides proof of a valid, out-of-state, unexpired, professional-level credential. The bill would limit a comparable credential issued under these provisions to be valid only for the duration of those military orders, except as provided.Existing law requires, as a minimum requirement for a preliminary multiple subject, single subject, or education specialist teaching credential, the satisfactory completion of a program of professional preparation that includes a teaching performance assessment that meets specified requirements and has been approved by the commission, as provided.This bill would require the commission to exempt specified preliminary multiple subject credential candidates and preliminary single subject credential candidates from the requirement, and any accompanying regulations, to complete a teaching performance assessment, as provided.(19) Existing law establishes the Teacher Residency Grant Program and appropriates funds from the General Fund to the commission to make one-time grants to develop new, or expand, strengthen, or improve access to existing, teacher and school counselor residency programs. Existing law requires grants provided for this purpose to be up to $25,000 per residency candidate. Existing law requires a residency candidate to agree to serve in a school within the jurisdiction of the grant recipient that sponsored the candidate for at least 4 school years, as provided. Existing law requires the commission to conduct evaluations of the grants and to provide a report to the Department of Finance and the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature on or before December 1, 2027.This bill would require a residency candidate to instead agree to serve in any public school in California for at least 4 school years. The bill would increase the amount of the grants to instead be up to $40,000 per residency candidate. The bill would require grant recipients receiving an award during and after the 2023–24 fiscal year to provide residency candidates with a minimum compensation package of no less than $20,000. The bill would also extend by 2 years the deadline by which the commission is required to provide the above-described report to December 1, 2029.(20) Existing law establishes the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program. Existing law authorizes a local educational agency that elects to operate an expanded learning opportunity program to operate a before school component of a program, an after school component of a program, or both, and requires the local educational agency to comply with specified requirements, including the development of a program plan, as specified.This bill would, among other things, specify licensing requirements for purposes of the program depending on whether the expanded learning opportunity program is operated directly by a local educational agency or by a third party, as provided, and would require the Superintendent, in consultation with the State Department of Social Services, to establish a process and a timeline for local educational agencies that contract with third-party providers to operate expanded learning opportunity programs at a location other than a local educational agency’s school campus pursuant to these provisions and California state preschool program providers to annually submit program access information to the State Department of Education, as specified. The bill would require the State Department of Education to distribute a compiled list to the State Department of Social Services for purposes of Community Care Licensing Division data collection and submission to a local educational agency’s applicable resource and referral agency. The bill would require the Superintendent, in consultation with the State Department of Social Services, to submit a report to the relevant fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature relating to these provisions, as specified.Existing law requires the Superintendent to allocate funding for the program, as specified, and authorizes a charter school or school district, for the 2021–22 fiscal year, to expend the funds from the Superintendent from the 2021–22 and 2022–23 fiscal years, and, for the 2022–23 fiscal year, authorizes those local educational agencies to expend the funds received from the Superintendent from the 2022–23 and 2023–24 fiscal years.The bill would authorize charter schools and school districts, for the 2021–22 fiscal year, to instead expend or encumber the funds from the Superintendent from the 2021–22 fiscal year to the 2023–24 fiscal year, inclusive, and, for the 2023–24 fiscal year, would authorize those local educational agencies to instead expend or encumber the funds received from the Superintendent from the 2022–23 and 2023–24 fiscal years.(21) For purposes of state apportionments, if the average daily attendance of a school district, county office of education, or charter school during a fiscal year has been materially decreased during a fiscal year because of an emergency, existing law requires the Superintendent to estimate the average daily attendance in a manner that credits to the school district, county office of education, or charter school the total average daily attendance that would have been credited had the emergency not occurred. Existing law requires the Superintendent to make specified calculations for purposes of state apportionments to a school district, county office of education, or charter school affected by the state of emergency declared by the Governor in November 2018, as provided. For the 2020–21 fiscal year for school districts, existing law requires the Superintendent to calculate the difference between the school district’s certified second principal apportionment local control funding formula entitlement in the 2020–21 fiscal year and the 2019–20 fiscal year and, if there is a difference, to allocate the amount of that difference to the school district, and for the 2021–22 fiscal year, requires the Superintendent to allocate an amount equal to 25% of the difference calculated by the Superintendent for the 2020–21 fiscal year. Existing law continuously appropriates the amounts necessary to provide those apportionments.This bill would require the Superintendent, for the 2022–23 fiscal year for school districts, to allocate an amount equal to 12.5% of the difference calculated by the Superintendent for the 2020–21 fiscal year, thereby making an appropriation.(22) Existing law provides for the funding of necessary small schools and high schools, as specified. Existing law requires, among other things, that funding to include various specified amounts per pupil and teacher for different tiers of numbers of pupils and teachers. Existing law extends certain necessary small school funding provisions to school districts where a school eligible for necessary small school funding was destroyed as a result of a state of emergency that was declared by the Governor in August 2021 by authorizing school districts to continue to report the amount of attendance generated by pupils enrolled in another school of the school district that would have otherwise attended the destroyed school, and the number of full-time teachers employed by the school district that would have otherwise provided instructional services at the school, as if the school were operational in the 2021–22 and 2022–23 fiscal years. Existing law requires those schools to be considered a necessary small school for these purposes for the 2022–23 fiscal year.This bill would extend the applicability of those provisions to the 2023–24 fiscal year, as provided.(23) Existing law authorizes a school district or charter school to maintain a transitional kindergarten program. Existing law requires a school district or charter school to, as a condition of receipt of apportionment for pupils in a transitional kindergarten program, commencing with the 2023–24 school year, and for each year thereafter, maintain an average of at least one adult for every 10 pupils for transitional kindergarten classrooms, contingent upon an appropriation of funds. Existing law also requires, as a condition of receipt of apportionment for pupils in a transitional kindergarten program, a school district or charter school to ensure that credentialed teachers who are first assigned to a transitional kindergarten classroom after July 1, 2015, have, by August 1, 2023, met one of 3 designated criteria establishing qualification for the position. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction, commencing with the 2022–23 school year, to withhold a school district’s or charter school’s entitlements if a school district or charter school fails to comply with certain requirements, including, among others, the above-described qualification requirements, as specified.This bill would delay the start of the requirement that a school district or charter school maintain an average of at least one adult for every 10 pupils for transitional kindergarten classrooms at each schoolsite until the 2025–26 school year, and would delete the requirement that this provision be contingent upon an appropriation of funds. The bill would delay until August 1, 2025, the deadline for a credentialed teacher first assigned to a transitional kindergarten classroom after July 1, 2015, to meet one of the designated criteria referenced above, and would make a conforming change to the above-described withholding provision.Existing law authorizes, in any school year, a school district or charter school to, at any time during a school year, admit a child to a transitional kindergarten program who will have their 5th birthday after the applicable cutoff date but during that same school year, as provided.This bill, notwithstanding that provision, would authorize a school district or charter school to enroll an early enrollment child, as defined, in a transitional kindergarten program if specified conditions are met, including, among others, that any classroom that includes an early enrollment child maintains an adult-to-pupil ratio of at least one adult to every 10 pupils, and would penalize a school district or charter school that fails to meet at least one of certain requirements, as provided. Under the bill, a pupil admitted to a transitional kindergarten program pursuant to these provisions is prohibited from generating average daily attendance or being included in the enrollment or unduplicated pupil count until the pupil has attained their 5th birthday. The bill, beginning July 1, 2023, and for the 2023–24 and 2024–25 school years, would require a school district or charter school that offers transitional kindergarten to early enrollment children to concurrently offer enrollment in a California state preschool program that is operated by the school district or charter school if it operates a California state preschool program and that program is not fully subscribed, and would authorize the school district or charter school to enroll an early enrollment child in the program, regardless of income, after all other eligible children have been enrolled. The bill would, for the 2023–24 and 2024–25 school years, require school districts and charter schools that serve early enrollment children in transitional kindergarten to report specified information to the State Department of Education, and would require the department to report that information, as specified, to the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature by October 1, 2024, and again by October 1, 2025. The bill would make these provisions inoperative on July 1, 2025.(24) Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district or a county board of education to request the state board to waive all or part of specified education laws or regulations adopted by the state board, as provided, with exceptions. Existing law establishes provisions relating to transitional kindergarten and kindergarten admission.This bill would prohibit the state board from waiving all or part of certain laws relating to kindergarten and transitional kindergarten admission.(25) The Charter Schools Act of 1992 authorizes the establishment and operation of charter schools. Existing law authorizes a charter school to appeal a school district’s decision to deny a charter petition to the county board of education and, if the county board of education upholds the decision, to appeal the county board of education’s decision to the State Board of Education. Existing law authorizes the state board to reverse those decisions only upon a determination that there was an abuse of discretion.This bill would instead authorize the state board to reverse those decisions only upon a determination that there was an abuse of discretion by each of the school district and the county board of education.Existing law authorizes a chartering authority to renew the approval of a charter school petition under specified procedures.
